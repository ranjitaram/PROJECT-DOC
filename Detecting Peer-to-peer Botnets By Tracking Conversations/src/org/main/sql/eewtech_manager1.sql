However, multimedia, interactive and high\r\ndefinition applications push for very high speed access networks, where each\r\nuser is given a bandwidth greater than 100 Mbit/s. Passive Optical Network\r\n(PON) is a promising technology to solve the last mile problem. Ethernet over\r\nPON (EPON) has been regulated by IEEE and it is the subject of this work. In\r\norder to connect all users, not just business but also residential, point-to-point\r\nfibres from the central office should be installed. This approach comes to be too\r\nexpensive since two transceivers per line should be employed. Thus, the point-tomultipoint\r\n(P2MP) topology is rather used where one single fibre is used both for\r\ndown and upstream data communications. Following this, a concentrator is\r\nplaced closed to a set of users with a passive coupler for connecting them.\r\nSeveral P2MP topologies are possible: tree, bus and ring. Here a bus topology\r\nwill be considered. Fibre-to-the-curb (FTTC), fibre-to-the-building (FTTB) and\r\nfibre-to-the-home (FTTH) are possible ways to implement PON depending on\r\nwhere the fibre from the Optical Line Terminal (OLT), which is point-to-point\r\nconnected to the network backbone, ends its run, at the curb, at the building or at\r\nhome, respectively. Data transmissions are full-duplex over the PON and they are\r\non separate channels. Downstream is the flow from the core to the OLT and then\r\nto the ONUs (Optical Network Unit), close to the users, while upstream is the data\r\nflow from users to the core network. Since there is one communication channel\r\nonly from OLT to the core, a user access control for upstream transmissions has\r\nto be implemented to avoid collisions. The most common dimension in this\r\nscenario for contention resolution is the time, through Time Division Multiplexing.\r\nDownstream transmissions are broadcasted by OLT to all ONUs and data frames\r\nhave a variable length up to 1500 bytes. These frames are broadcasted through a\r\n1:N splitter, where N can be from 4 to 64 depending on the optical power\r\navailable. Each frame has a label in the header which uniquely identifies the\r\ndestination ONU. A ONU selectively reads incoming frames, forwarding the ones\r\ncontaining its identifier only. As mentioned above, upstream communications use\r\nTDM, where each ONU is assigned a time slot by OLT, in order to solve possible\r\ncontentions, and two time slots are separated by a time guard interval. During\r\neach time slot more Ethernet frames may be transmitted. If N is the number of\r\nONU, the set of N time slots is called cycle. When the ONU has the right to\r\ntransmit, during its time slot, it is allowed to send all queued packets at top speed,\r\nfor instance 1 Gbit/s.', '', '../admin/upload/algorithm/pdf/1401803719_Poster.pdf', '', '', 'Y'),

The AdaBoost algorithm [24] proposed\r\nby Yoav Freund and Robert Schapire is one of the most important ensemble methods,\r\nsince it has solid theoretical foundation, very accurate prediction, great simplicity (Schapire\r\nsaid it needs only â€œjust 10 lines of codeâ€), and wide and successful applications.\r\nLet X denote the instance space and Y the set of class labels. Assume Y = {âˆ’1,+1}.\r\nGiven a weak or base learning algorithm and a training set {(x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xm, ym)}\r\nwhere xi âˆˆ X and yi âˆˆ Y (i = 1, . . . ,m), the AdaBoost algorithm works as follows. First,\r\nit assigns equal weights to all the training examples (xi , yi )(i âˆˆ {1, . . . ,m}). Denote the\r\ndistribution of the weights at the t-th learning round as Dt . From the training set and Dt\r\nthe algorithm generates a weak or base learner ht : X â†’ Y by calling the base learning\r\nalgorithm. Then, it uses the training examples to test ht , and the weights of the incorrectly\r\nclassified examples will be increased. Thus, an updated weight distribution Dt+1 is obtained.\r\nFrom the training set and Dt+1 AdaBoost generates another weak learner by calling the\r\nbase learning algorithm again. Such a process is repeated for T rounds, and the final model is\r\nderived byweighted majority voting of the T weak learners,where theweights of the learners\r\nare determined during the training process. In practice, the base learning algorithm may be a\r\nlearning algorithm which can use weighted training examples directly; otherwise the weights\r\ncan be exploited by sampling the training examples according to the weight distribution Dt .\r\nThe pseudo-code of AdaBoost is shown in Fig. 5.\r\nIn order to deal with multi-class problems, Freund and Schapire presented the Ada-\r\nBoost.M1 algorithm [24] which requires that the weak learners are strong enough even\r\non hard distributions generated during the AdaBoost process. Another popular multi-class\r\nversion of AdaBoost is AdaBoost.MH [69] which works by decomposing multi-class task to\r\na series of binary tasks. AdaBoost algorithms for dealing with regression problems have also\r\nbeen studied. Since many variants of AdaBoost have been developed during the past decade,\r\nBoosting has become the most important â€œfamilyâ€ of ensemble methods.\r\n7.2 Impact of the algorithm\r\nAs mentioned in Sect. 7.1, AdaBoost is one of the most important ensemble methods, so it is\r\nnot strange that its high impact can be observed here and there. In this short article we only\r\nbriefly introduce two issues, one theoretical and the other applied.\r\nIn 1988, Kearns and Valiant posed an interesting question, i.e., whether a weak learning\r\nalgorithm that performs just slightly better than random guess could be â€œboostedâ€ into an\r\narbitrarily accurate strong learning algorithm. In other words, whether two complexity classes,\r\nweakly learnable and strongly learnable problems, are equal. Schapire [67] found that\r\nthe answer to the question is â€œyesâ€, and the proof he gave is a construction, which is the first\r\nBoosting algorithm. So, it is evident that AdaBoost was born with theoretical significance.\r\nAdaBoost has given rise to abundant research on theoretical aspects of ensemble methods,\r\nwhich can be easily found in machine learning and statistics literature. It is worth mentioning\r\nthat for their AdaBoost paper [24], Schapire and Freund won the Godel Prize, which is one\r\nof the most prestigious awards in theoretical computer science, in the year of 2003.', '', '', '', '../admin/upload/algorithm/doc/1401784351_AdaBoost Algorithm.docx', 'Y'),

Backpressure principles can also be applied to other areas, such as to the study of product assembly systems and processing networks [3] . This article focuses on communication networks, where packets from multiple data streams arrive and must be delivered to appropriate destinations. The backpressure algorithm operates in slotted time. Every time slot it seeks to route data in directions that maximize the differential backlog between neighboring nodes. This is similar to how water flows through a network of pipes via pressure gradients. However, the backpressure algorithm can be applied to multi-commodity networks (where different packets may have different destinations), and to networks where transmission rates can be selected from a set of (possibly time-varying) options. Attractive features of the backpressure algorithm are: (i) it leads to maximum network throughput, (ii) it is provably robust to time-varying network conditions, (iii) it can be implemented without knowing traffic arrival rates or channel state probabilities.

It has a sound theoretical foundation, requires only a dozen examples for training,\r\nand is insensitive to the number of dimensions. In addition, efficient methods for training\r\nSVM are also being developed at a fast pace.\r\nIn a two-class learning task, the aim of SVM is to find the best classification function\r\nto distinguish between members of the two classes in the training data. The metric for the\r\nconcept of the â€œbestâ€ classification function can be realized geometrically. For a linearly separable\r\ndataset, a linear classification function corresponds to a separating hyperplane f (x)\r\nthat passes through the middle of the two classes, separating the two. Once this function is\r\ndetermined, new data instance xn can be classified by simply testing the sign of the function\r\nf (xn); xn belongs to the positive class if f (xn) > 0.\r\nBecause there are many such linear hyperplanes, what SVM additionally guarantee is that\r\nthe best such function is found by maximizing the margin between the two classes. Intuitively,\r\nthe margin is defined as the amount of space, or separation between the two classes\r\nas defined by the hyperplane. Geometrically, the margin corresponds to the shortest distance\r\nbetween the closest data points to a point on the hyperplane. Having this geometric definition\r\nallows us to explore how to maximize the margin, so that even though there are an infinite\r\nnumber of hyperplanes, only a few qualify as the solution to SVM.\r\nThe reason why SVM insists on finding the maximum margin hyperplanes is that it offers\r\nthe best generalization ability. It allows not only the best classification performance (e.g.,\r\naccuracy) on the training data, but also leaves much room for the correct classification of the\r\nfuture data. To ensure that the maximum margin hyperplanes are actually found, an SVM\r\nclassifier attempts to maximize the following function with respect to _w and b:\r\n \r\nwhere t is the number of training examples, and Î±i , i = 1, . . . , t, are non-negative numbers\r\nsuch that the derivatives of L P with respect to Î±i are zero. Î±i are the Lagrange multipliers\r\nand L P is called the Lagrangian. In this equation, the vectors _w and constant b define the\r\nhyperplane.\r\nThere are several important questions and related extensions on the above basic formulation\r\nof support vector machines. We list these questions and extensions below.\r\n1. Can we understand the meaning of the SVM through a solid theoretical foundation?\r\n2. Can we extend the SVM formulation to handle cases where we allow errors to exist,\r\nwhen even the best hyperplane must admit some errors on the training data?\r\n3. Can we extend the SVM formulation so that it works in situations where the training\r\ndata are not linearly separable?\r\n4. Can we extend the SVM formulation so that the task is to predict numerical values or\r\nto rank the instances in the likelihood of being a positive class member, rather than\r\nclassification?', '', '', '', '../admin/upload/algorithm/doc/1401781423_Support vector machines.docx', 'Y'),

A detailed history of k-means alongwith descriptions\r\nof several variations are given in [43].

Undoubtedly, the advent of these connections has impacted all aspects of our lives. The decentralized nature of the internet forms its very foundation, yet ironically, this nature has opened networks and individual machines to a host of threats and attacks from cyber-criminals. Cyber-crime includes, but is not limited to, the theft of trade secrets, theft of or destruction of intellectual property and fraud. Trade secrets and intellectual property is typically the foundation upon which many companies are built. \r\nThis information gives each company a competitive advantage and to have such information compromised in any way could easily cost the company millions. In addition, since money is no longer exclusively paper based due to online trading, financial fraud such as credit card misuse is propagated once a criminal gains access to enterprise information systems. Cyber obscenity is one of the more popular forms of cyber crime. Essentially, pornographic material, such as child pornography, is hidden on storage media since perpetrators acknowledge the illegality of being in possession of these images. \r\nCyber-criminals associate themselves with one of or all of these crimes by making it their jobs to find vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications or services that run on a computer connected to the internet. Once vulnerability is discovered and exploited, the criminal is able to view or store sensitive information on some form of storage media. The storage medium can either be local, i.e. hard-drives or removable, i.e. floppy disks, zip drives, memory sticks or CDs. Once the crime is committed, prosecution becomes extremely difficult since the crime venue could easily be in different cities and countries and involve unsuspecting third parties. \r\nAt this point, a computer forensic specialist (CFS) is tasked to investigate the digital crime scene by impartially scrutinizing a number of digital sources that are either involved or thought to be involved in the crime, and ultimately produce a single document reflecting a summary of the contents of the digital source.', NULL, '', 'Y'),

The information of the bottom-right and\r\nupper left boundary of the network area is configured into\r\neach node when it joins in the system. This information\r\nenables a node to locate the positions of nodes in the entire\r\narea for zone partitions in ALERT.\r\nALERT features a dynamic and unpredictable routing\r\npath, which consists of a number of dynamically determined\r\nintermediate relay nodes. As shown in the upper\r\npart of Fig. 1, given an area, we horizontally partition it into\r\ntwo zones A1 and A2. We then vertically partition zone A1\r\nto B1 and B2. After that, we horizontally partition zone B2\r\ninto two zones. Such zone partitioning consecutively splits\r\nthe smallest zone in an alternating horizontal and vertical\r\nmanner. We call this partition process hierarchical zone\r\npartition. ALERT uses the hierarchical zone partition and\r\nrandomly chooses a node in the partitioned zone in each\r\nstep as an intermediate relay node (i.e., data forwarder),\r\nthus dynamically generating an unpredictable routing path\r\nfor a message.\r\nFig. 2 shows an example of routing in ALERT. We call the\r\nzone having k nodes where D resides the destination zone,\r\ndenoted as ZD. k is used to control the degree of anonymity\r\nprotection for the destination. The shaded zone in Fig. 2 is\r\nthe destination zone. Specifically, in the ALERT routing,\r\neach data source or forwarder executes the hierarchical zone\r\npartition. It first checks whether itself and destination are in\r\nthe same zone. If so, it divides the zone alternatively in the\r\nhorizonal and vertical directions. The node repeats this \r\nprocess until itself and ZD are not in the same zone. It then\r\nrandomly chooses a position in the other zone called\r\ntemporary destination (TD), and uses the GPSR routing\r\nalgorithm to send the data to the node closest to TD. This\r\nnode is defined as a random forwarder (RF). Fig. 3 shows an\r\nexample where node N3 is the closest to TD, so it is selected\r\nas a RF. ALERT aims at achieving k-anonymity [25] for\r\ndestination node D, where k is a predefined integer. Thus, in\r\nthe last step, the data are broadcasted to k nodes in ZD,\r\nproviding k-anonymity to the destination.\r\nGiven an S-D pair, the partition pattern in ALERT varies\r\ndepending on the randomly selected TDs and the order of\r\nhorizontal and vertical division, which provides a better\r\nanonymity protection. Fig. 1 shows two possible routing\r\npaths for a packet pkt issued by sender S targeting\r\ndestination D in ALERT. There are also many other possible\r\npaths. In the upper routing flow, data source S first\r\nhorizontally divides the area into two equal-size zones, A1\r\nand A2, in order to separate S and ZD. S then randomly\r\nselects the first temporary destination TD1 in zone A1\r\nwhere ZD resides. Then, S relies on GPSR to send pkt to\r\nTD1. The pkt is forwarded by several relays until reaching a\r\nnode that cannot find a neighbor closer to TD1. This node is\r\nconsidered to be the first random-forwarder RF1. After RF1\r\nreceives pkt, it vertically divides the region A1 into regions\r\nB1 and B2 so that ZD and itself are separated in two\r\ndifferent zones. Then, RF1 randomly selects the next\r\ntemporary destination TD2 and uses GPSR to send pkt to\r\nTD2. This process is repeated until a packet receiver finds\r\nitself residing in ZD, i.e., a partitioned zone is ZD having k\r\nnodes. Then, the node broadcasts the pkt to the k nodes.\r\nThe lower part of Fig. 1 shows another routing path\r\nbased on a different partition pattern. After S vertically\r\npartitions the whole area to separate itself from ZD, it\r\nrandomly chooses TD1 and sends pkt to RF1. RF1\r\npartitions zone A2 into B1 and B2 horizontally and then\r\npartitions B1 into C1 and C2 vertically, so that itself and ZD\r\nare separated. Note that RF1 could vertically partition A2 to\r\nseparate itself from ZD in two zones but may choose a TD\r\nfurther away from the destination than the TD that resulted\r\nfrom the horizontal partition. Therefore, ALERT sets the\r\npartition in the alternative horizontal and vertical manner\r\nin order to ensure that a pkt approaches D in each step.\r\nAs GPSR, we assume that the destination node will not\r\nmove far away from its position during the data transmission,\r\nso it can successfully receive the data. In this design,\r\nthe tradeoff is the anonymity protection degree and\r\ntransmission delay. A larger number of hierarchies generate\r\nmore routing hops, which increases anonymity degree but\r\nalso increases the delay. To ensure the delivery of packets,\r\nthe destination sends a confirmation to the source upon\r\nreceiving the packets. If the source has not received the\r\nconfirmation during a predefined time period, it will resend\r\nthe packets.\r\nALARM\r\nALARM: Anonymous Location-Aided Routing\r\nWe require an off-line group manager (GM) that\r\ninitializes the underlying group signature scheme and\r\nenrolls all legitimate MANET nodes as group members.\r\n(This is done well before MANET deployment.) In case\r\nof a dispute, the GM is responsible for opening the\r\ncontested group signature and determining the signer.\r\nDepending on the specific group signature scheme, the\r\nGM may also have to handle future joins for new\r\nmembers as well as revocation of existing members.\r\nHowever, we claim that in most envisaged MANET\r\nscenarios, membership is likely to be fixed, i.e., all joins\r\ncan be done in bulk, a priori. Also, revocation might not\r\nbe feasible since it would require propagating â€“ in realtime\r\nâ€“ updated revocation information to all legitimate\r\nMANET nodes. (However, if dynamic membership is\r\nnecessary, our scheme is capable of supporting it, with\r\nminor additional assumptions.)\r\nThe basic operation of ALARM is as follows:\r\nâ€¢ Time is divided into time slots of duration T. At\r\nthe beginning of every slot, each node broadcasts a\r\nmessage containing: its location (GPS coordinates),\r\ntime-stamp, temporary public key and a group signature\r\ncomputed over these fields. We call this a\r\nLocation Announcement Message (LAM). Each\r\nLAM is flooded throughout the MANET. Figure\r\n1 shows the LAM format used to construct the\r\nnetwork topology snapshot in Figure 2.\r\nâ€¢ In the period between successive LAM-s, a node\r\ncan be reached using a pseudonym which is set to\r\nthe group signature in its last LAM. (Assuming, of\r\ncourse, that the signature is valid.) Each node that\r\nreceives a LAM, first verifies the group signature.If the signature is valid, the node broadcasts the\r\nmessage to its neighbors unless it has previously\r\nreceived the same message. Having collected all\r\ncurrent LAM-s, each node can easily construct a\r\ngeographical map and a connectivity graph of the\r\nMANET.\r\nâ€¢ If a node needs to communicate to a certain location,\r\nit first checks to see if there is a node at\r\n(or near) that location. If so, it sends a message\r\nto the destination pseudonym (determined by the\r\ngroup signature in the last LAM corresponding to\r\nthat location). The message is encrypted with the\r\npublic key included in the same LAM. We do not\r\nrestrict our scheme to a particular cryptographic\r\nmechanism. One obvious choice is to use Diffie-\r\nHellman (DH) [41] whereby each LAM includes\r\nan ephemeral (period-specific) DH half-key. The\r\nsender then simply generates its own DH halfkey,\r\ncomputes a shared key and uses it to encrypt\r\nthe message.

One of the first responses to the challenge was developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest,\r\nAdi Shamir, Len Adleman at MIT. Since then, the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) scheme has become\r\nthe most widely accepted and implemented general-purpose approach to public-key encryption1\r\n.

MATHEMATICAL PRELIMINARIES\r\nIn this section, we will introduce the mathematical background that helps to understand RSA.\r\nA. Modular Addition\r\nLetâ€™s start with one of the simplest ciphers: general Caesar cipher. Its encryption and decryption\r\noperation can be represented using the following mathematical functions.\r\nC = (P + K) mod 26 (1)\r\nP = (C âˆ’ K) mod 26 (2)\r\n1Recently, a competing system has begun to challenge RSA: elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), which offers equal security for a far\r\nsmaller key size, thereby reducing processing overhead.2\r\nP \\\\ K 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\r\n0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\r\n1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0\r\n2 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\r\n3 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2\r\n4 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3\r\n5 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4\r\n6 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5\r\n7 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\r\n8 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\r\n9 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\r\nTABLE I\r\nADDITION MODULO 10\r\nFor simplicity, we replace 26 with 10, and show the general Caesar cipher, which is also the modular\r\naddition operation, in Table I. Note that the decryption operation, which subtracts the secret key K from\r\nciphertext C modulo 10, can also be done by adding Kâ€²\r\n, which is the additive inverse of K modulo 10.\r\nAn additive modular inverse of K is the number which is added to K to get 0 after modular operation.\r\nFor example, 4â€™s inverse (modulo 10) is 6, because (4 + 6) mod 10 = 0. If the secret key were 4, then to\r\nencrypt in general Caesar cipher, 4 is added to the plaintext; and to decrypt, 6 is added to the ciphertext.\r\nFormally, we have\r\nC = (P + K) mod 26 (3)\r\nP = (C + Kâ€²\r\n) mod 26 (4)\r\nwhere\r\nK + Kâ€² mod 10 = 0. (5)\r\nB. Modular Multiplication\r\nNow letâ€™s look at the mod 10 multiplication operation as shown in Table II. We note that only when\r\nK = 1, 3, 7, 9, the modular multiplication operation works as a cipher, because it only performs a one-toone\r\nmapping between the plaintext and the ciphertext in these cases. What is special about the numbers\r\n{1, 3, 7, 9}? The answer is that those numbers are all relatively prime to 10. Generally, a number K is\r\nrelatively prime to n means3\r\nP \\\\ K 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\r\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\r\n2 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8\r\n3 0 3 6 9 2 5 8 1 4 7\r\n4 0 4 8 2 6 0 4 8 2 6\r\n5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5\r\n6 0 6 2 8 4 0 6 2 8 4\r\n7 0 7 4 1 8 5 2 9 6 3\r\n8 0 8 6 4 2 0 8 6 4 2\r\n9 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\r\nTABLE II\r\nMULTIPLICATION MODULO 10\r\ngcd(K, n) = 1; 1 â‰¤ K < n (6)\r\nwhere gcd denotes the greatest common divisor.\r\nFor decryption, we can look for multiplicative inverse, and undo the multiplication by multiplying the\r\nciphertext by the multiplicative inverse of the key. Multiplicative inverse of K, denoted by Kâˆ’1\r\n, is the\r\nnumber by which youâ€™d multiply K to get 1 in mod n. Formally, the cryptosystem can be represented as\r\nfollows.\r\nC = (P Â· K) mod n (7)\r\nP = (C Â· K\r\nâˆ’1\r\n) mod n (8)\r\nwhere\r\nK Â· Kâˆ’1 mod n = 1 (9)\r\nNote that only those numbers that are relatively prime to n have multiplicative inverses in mod n. It\r\nis non-trivial to to find a multiplicative inverse in mod n arithmetic, especially when n is very large. But\r\nthere is an algorithm, known as Euclidâ€™s algorithm, which can efficiently find the inverse2\r\n.\r\nAt this point, we observe that the modular multiplication can also be used as a cipher, if the value\r\nof K is chosen appropriately. Moreover, K and Kâˆ’1\r\ncan be used as a pair of keys for encryption and\r\ndecryption, which is required by public-key encryption model. The problem is, however, there exists an\r\n2For details, please refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean algorithm, or step II in the hint.pdf file for homework 1.4\r\nalgorithm (Euclidâ€™s algorithm) to calculate Kâˆ’1 based on K, while in public-key encryption model, the\r\nprivate key can not be derived from knowledge of the public key.\r\nSo letâ€™s further explore other mathematical functions. Before that, weâ€™d examine the question how many\r\nnumbers less than n are relatively prime to n? This number is denoted as Ï†(n), and called totient function.\r\nAs we will see later, this number is quite important in the design of RSA. It is obvious that,\r\nâ€¢ when n is a prime, Ï†(n) = n âˆ’ 1;\r\nâ€¢ when n is the product of two district primes p, q, (i.e., n = p Â· q, p 6= q are primes), Ï†(n) =\r\n(p âˆ’ 1)(q âˆ’ 1).\r\nC. Modular Exponentiation\r\nNow letâ€™s proceed to consider encryption and decryption using modular exponentiation operation.\r\nC = (P\r\nK) mod n (10)\r\nP = (C\r\nKâ€²â€²) mod n (11)\r\nwhere Kâ€²â€² is the exponentiative inverse of K.\r\nJust like multiplicative inverse, we may ask what kind of values of K has the exponentiative inverse?\r\nand how its inverse can be calculated? The answers to these questions lead to the design of RSA. In\r\nwhat follows, we give a description of RSA algorithm first, then discuss how it is related with modular\r\nexponentiation.\r\nII. RSA DESCRIPTION\r\nThe RSA scheme is a block cipher. Each plaintext block is an integer between 0 and n âˆ’ 1 for some\r\nn, which leads to a block size â‰¤ log2(n). The typical size for n is 1024 bits. The details of the RSA\r\nalgorithm are described as follows.\r\nâ€¢ Key generation\r\n1) Pick two large prime numbers p and q, p 6= q;\r\n2) Calculate n = p Ã— q;\r\n3) Calculate Ï†(n) = (p âˆ’ 1)(q âˆ’ 1);\r\n4) Pick e, so that gcd(e, Ï†(n)) = 1, 1 < e < Ï†(n);\r\n5) Calculate d, so that d Â· e mod Ï†(n) = 1, i.e., d is the multiplicative inverse of e in mod Ï†(n);5\r\n6) Get public key as KU = {e, n};\r\n7) Get private key as KR = {d, n}.\r\nâ€¢ Encryption\r\nFor plaintext block P < n, its ciphertext C = P\r\ne mod n.\r\nâ€¢ Decryption\r\nFor ciphertext block C, its plaintext is P = C\r\nd mod n.\r\nA. Why RSA works\r\nAs we have seen from the RSA design, RSA algorithm uses modular exponentiation operation. For\r\nn = p Â· q, e which is relatively prime to Ï†(n), has exponential inverse in mod n. Its exponential inverse\r\nd can be calculated as the multiplicative inverse of e in mod Ï†(n). The reason is illustrated as follows.\r\nBased on Eulerâ€™s theorem, for y which satisfies y mod Ï†(n) = 1, the following equation holds.\r\nx\r\ny mod n = x mod n (12)\r\nAs d Â· e mod Ï†(n) = 1, we have that P\r\ned â‰¡ P mod n. So the correctness of RSA cryptosystem is\r\nshown as follows.\r\nâ€¢ Encryption: C = P\r\ne mod n;\r\nâ€¢ Decryption: P = C\r\nd mod n = (P\r\ne\r\n)\r\nd mod n = P\r\ned mod n = P mod n = P.\r\nB. Why RSA is secure\r\nThe premise behind RSAâ€™s security is the assumption that factoring a big number (n into p, and q)\r\nis hard. And thus it is difficult to determine Ï†(n). Without the knowledge of Ï†(n), it would be hard to\r\nderive d based on the knowledge of e.\r\nHowever factoring n is not the only way to break RSA. Students are encouraged to read the suggested\r\nmaterial to find out more threats to RSA.', '', NULL, 'Y'),

An extension is the notion of overlapping slicing, which duplicates an attribute in more than one column. These releases more attribute correlations. For example, in Table, one could choose to include the Disease attribute also in the first column. That is, the two columns are {Age, Sex, Disease} and {Zip code, Disease}. This could provide better data utility, but the privacy implications need to be carefully studied and understood. It is interesting to study the tradeoff between privacy and utility.\r\nSecond, we plan to study membership disclosure protection in more details. Our experiments show that random grouping is not very effective. We plan to design more effective tuple grouping algorithms.\r\nThird, slicing is a promising technique for handling high-dimensional data.

Although recent intrusion detection systems can recognize and take against attacks, comparatively little research focuses on after-the-fact investigation. This is, in part, because network owners are more willing to absorb losses from computer crime that risk their reputations by letting details of their exploited vulnerabilities become public. More number of cyber attacks is possible in the systems. Those are hacking, Dos attack, DDoS attacks, Software Piracy attacks, Pornography attacks, Spoofing attack, Virus attack, Threatening attacks, Phishing attacks, Salami attack, Zeroday attack and war driving attack. This cyber attacks are mostly identified by the digital forensic investigation. \r\nDigital forensics has existed for as long as computers have stored data that could be used as evidence. For many years, digital forensics was performed primarily by government agencies, but has become common in the commercial sector over the past several years. Originally, much of the analysis software was custom and proprietary and eventually specialized analysis software was made available for both the private and public sectors. Recently, open source alternatives have been developed that provide comparable features.\r\nIn general, the goal of digital forensic analysis is to identify digital evidence for an investigation. An investigation typically uses both physical and digital evidence with the scientific method to draw conclusions. Examples of investigations that use digital forensics include computer intrusion, unauthorized use of corporate computers, child pornography, and any physical crime whose suspect had a computer.\r\nTo see the challenges faced by the next generation of digital forensics tools, we examine the looming problems of scale that will soon overwhelm current generation tools. The primary challenges are fueled by fundamental trends in computing and communication technologies that will persist for the foreseeable future. Storage capacity and bandwidth available to consumers are growing extremely rapidly, while unit prices are dropping dramatically. Coupled with the consumerâ€™s urge to have everything online, where music collections, movies, and photographs will increasingly be stored solely in digital form, these trends will result in even consumer-grade computers having huge amounts of storage. From a forensics perspective, this translates into rapid growth of the number and size of potential investigative targets. To be ready, forensic professionals need to scale up both their machine and human resources accordingly.\r\nA digital forensic investigation is an inquiry into the unfamiliar or questionable activities in the Cyber space or digital world. The File system investigation is the identification, collection and analysis of the evidence from the storage media. File systems or file management systems is a part of operating system which organize and locate sectors for file storage. \r\n \r\nFig.1 Digital Forensic Tool\r\nDigital Forensics is the recovery of data from any type of digital device or media that is retrievable through professional analysis, scientific processes and methodogies that can be validated and potentially utilized in a court of law as evidence. Forensic Analysis is the use of controlled and documented analytical and investigative techniques to identify, collect, examine, and preserve digital information. Recognizing the fragile nature of digital data, and the legal and regulatory requirements to properly preserve electronically stored information during forensic investigations, Secure State maintains standards relating to protecting electronically stored information against manipulation or destruction.\r\nTraditional forensic tools gather evidence from persistent storage devices such as hard drives. In contrast, newer forensic tools also collect ephemeral evidence from the memory of a running computer. Tools such as Volatility deconstruct and decipher the raw memory dumps and search for evidence of interest. While these tools can find evidence such as the process list, open network sockets and open files, which are directly related to the running system, they are often unable to provide deep semantic insight into the internal operations of the running programs. Without the use of time-consuming manual analysis or speciï¬cally developed tools, the forensic investigator cannot temporarily access or decipher all of the relevant evidence.\r\nForensic analysis is the use of controlled and documented analytical and investigative techniques to identify, collect, examine and preserve digital information. SecureState provides a thorough approach to the forensic methodology, and ensures all tools; methodologies and processes are forensically sound and unaltered. SecureState works as an extension of the corporationâ€™s response team to help ensure relevant and efficient analysis for three primary areas of forensics: Evidence Acquisition, Evidence Analysis, and Evidence Reporting.\r\n \r\nFig. 2 digital forensic\r\nForensic Acquisition: Computer Forensics Acquisition is the process of acquiring electronic evidence in a manner that preserves the data and maintains chain of custody. SecureState establishes tested and proven acquisition methodologies, information gathering and structured reporting of security related events. Electronic evidence contains the information needed to understand how the events happened, resources or data that may have been affected, and mitigation strategies. It is essential that electronic evidence is acquired in a methodical, safe, and secure manner.\r\n\r\nEvidence Collection: All evidence collection procedures are reviewed by SecureStateâ€™s Incident Response Team before acquisition begins. As deemed appropriate, SecureState is the custodian of data and the handler for response, evidence collection and retention, and data or device analysis. All imaging, data collection and documentation will be observed and supervised by a SecureState Lead Investigator.\r\n\r\nForensic Analysis: The primary scope for Forensic analysis is to identify unauthorized or anomalous indicators that exist (past or present), how they were deployed, and what capabilities they might have had on the system. After identifying if a successful compromise or malicious software exists, SecureStateâ€™s primary focus would be directed at determining applicable next steps relating to regulatory or legal compliance, as well as business impact and risk. Applicable next steps would involve additional forensic acquisition and documentation, collecting and identifying the initial intent of the compromise, remediation, and determining if any private, regulatory or sensitive data was captured or modified.\r\n\r\nDocumenting and Recording: All details, facts and processes will be documented as soon as the Response Team begins analysis on a potential incident or forensic investigation. SecureState will incorporate appropriate media for logging the incident process such as host records, tagging and labeling systems. Every step taken from the time the incident was detected and recorded to its resolution will be documented, time stamped, reviewed, and signed by the incident handler. Since documentation is an ongoing process throughout the examination, it is vital to be complete, accurate, and comprehensive during the reporting process. SecureState will safeguard data related to incidents since it will contain sensitive system or personnel information, data on exploited vulnerabilities, or information that may be needed for law enforcement. To reduce the risk of sensitive information being disclosed, SecureState ensures that access to incident data is restricted and properly stored. In accordance with applicable policies, rules, regulation, or other governing requirements, SecureState is responsible for the secure and timely delivery of its investigation reports, final incident reports, and all other reports required in accordance with the Incident Response Policies.\r\n\r\nWhen an incident occurs, the Incident Response Team may deem it necessary to perform a forensic investigation based upon legal, financial or regulatory requirements. The purpose of forensics is to determine actions, motives, vectors, effects, and evidence for incidents, misuse, theft, or fraudulent activities.\r\nHere system performs three types of analyzers. These are Network forensic analyzer, file analyzer and memory forensic analyzer. Network forensic analyzer is the process of network traffic analyzer. Network traffic analyzer is performed by network monitoring. A network analyzer is a computer program or a piece of computer hardware that can intercept and log traffic passing over a digital network or part of a network. As data streams flow across the network, the sniffer captures each packet and, if needed, decodes the packet''s raw data, showing the values of various fields in the packet, and analyzes its content according to the appropriate RFC or other specifications. For monitor this process here we use the jpcap tool. This jpcap tool monitors the networking details of the system. This jpcap tool monitors the traffic and displays the details like Source Mac, Destination Mac, Source IP, Destination IP and Captured Time. Then this data is stored as thumb data in the system. This thumb data is given to the input as the crime detection process. This crime detection process is detecting the attacks which are finding in the whole data. \r\nNext module is the file analyzer module. This file analyzer module is the process of analyze the file details. When system receive any other file from another system, here this file analyzer first monitor the receiving data, and analyze the modifying of this files and analyze the deletion of this file. This all analyzing data is then provided to the crime data mining. Here system identify the crime occurs in the system. \r\nFinally we perform the memory forensic modules. In these memory forensic modules, System goes to use the wmic tool. From this tool it detect the what are the process running in the system, what are the ports opened in the system, list out what are the services running in the system,  which system has booted up till that moment and Finally login session details of the users. Then this result also moves to the crime data mining. Here it detects what are the attacks occurred in the system.\r\nThese all the attacks and cyber crime are detect by using the crime data mining process. Cyber Crime Data mining is the extraction of Computer crime related data to determine crime patterns. With the growing sizes of databases, law enforcement and intelligence agencies face the challenge of analyzing large volumes of data involved in criminal and terrorist activities. Thus, a suitable scientific method for digital forensics is data mining. This crime data mining is working under the algorithm of k-mean and apriori algorithm.

This research focuses on one rapid and continuous data stream [19] of applications. For clarity, let G represent the overall stream which contains multiple and consecutive\r\nf. . . ; gx 2; gx 1; gx; gxÃ¾1; gxÃ¾2; . . .g Mini discrete streams.. gx: current Mini discrete stream which contains multiple and consecutive fux;1; ux;2; . . . ; ux;pg micro discrete streams.\r\n. x: fixed interval of the current month, fortnight, or week in the year.. p: variable number of micro discrete streams in a Mini discrete stream. Also, let ux;y represent the current microdiscrete stream\r\nwhich contains multiple and consecutive fvx;y;1; vx;y;2; . . . ; vx;y;qg applications. The current applicationâ€™s links are restricted to previous applications within a moving window, and this window can be larger than the number of applications within the current micro discrete stream.. y: fixed interval of the current day, hour, minute, or second.. q: variable number of applications in a micro discrete stream. Here, it is necessary to describe a single and continuous stream of applications as being made up of separate chunks: a Minidiscrete stream is long-term (for example, amonth of applications); while a microdiscrete stream is short-term (for example, a day of applications). They help to specify precisely when and how the detection systemwill automatically change its configurations. For example, the CD algorithm reconstructs its whitelist at the end of the month and resets its parameter values at the end of the day; the SD algorithm does attribute selection and updates CD attribute weights at the end of the month. Also, for example, long-term previous average score, longterm previous average links, and average density of each attribute are calculated from data in a Minidiscrete stream; short-term current average score and short-term current average links are calculated from data in a microdiscrete stream. With this data stream perspective in mind, the CD algorithm matches the current application against a moving window of previous applications. It accounts for attribute weights which reflect the degree of importance in attributes. The CD algorithm matches all links against the whitelist to find communal relationships and reduce their link score. It then calculates the current applicationâ€™s score using every link score and previous application score.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpike Detection\r\nThis section contrasts SD with CD; and presents the need\r\nfor SD, in order to improve resilience and adaptivity.\r\nBefore proceeding with a description of SD, it is\r\nnecessary to reinforce that CD finds real social relationships\r\nto reduce the suspicion score, and is tamper resistant to\r\nsynthetic social relationships. It is the whitelist-oriented\r\napproach on a fixed set of attributes. In contrast, SD finds\r\nspikes to increase the suspicion score, and is probe resistant\r\nfor attributes. Probe resistance reduces the chances a\r\nfraudster will discover attributes used in the SD score\r\ncalculation. It is the attribute-oriented approach on a\r\nvariable-size set of attributes. A side note: SD cannot use\r\na whitelist-oriented approach because it was not designed\r\nto create multiattribute links on a fixed-size set of attributes.\r\nCD has a fundamental weakness in its attribute threshold.\r\nSpecifically, CD must match at least three values for\r\nour data set. With less than three matched values, our\r\nwhitelist does not contain real social relationships because\r\nsome values, such as given name and unit number, are not\r\nunique identifiers. The fraudster can duplicate one or two\r\nimportant values which CD cannot detect.\r\nSD complements CD. The redundant attributes are either\r\ntoo sparse where no patterns can be detected, or too dense\r\nwhere no denser values can be found. The redundant\r\nattributes are continually filtered, only selected attributes in\r\nthe form of not-too-sparse and not-too-dense attributes are\r\nused for the SD suspicion score. In this way, the exposure of\r\nthe detection system to probing of attributes is reduced\r\nbecause only one or two attributes are adaptively selected.\r\nSuppose there was a bankâ€™s marketing campaign to give\r\nattractive benefits for itâ€™s new ladiesâ€™ platinum credit card.\r\nThis will cause a spike in the number of legitimate credit\r\ncard applications by women, which can be erroneously\r\ninterpreted by the system as a fraudster attack.', '', '', 'Y'),

This reduction is a trade off that results in some loss of effectiveness of data management or mining algorithms in order to gain some privacy. The t-closeness model extends the l-diversity model by treating the values of an attribute distinctly by taking into account the distribution of data values for that attribute.\r\nAttacks on l-diversity \r\nThis is useful because in real data sets attribute values may be skewed or semantically similar. However, accounting for value distributions may cause difficulty in creating feasible l-diverse representations. The l-diversity technique is useful in that it may hinder an attacker leveraging the global distribution of an attribute''s data values in order to infer information about sensitive data values. Not every value may exhibit equal sensitivity, for example, a rare positive indicator for a disease may provide more information than a common negative indicator. Because of examples like this, l-diversity may be difficult and unnecessary to achieve when protecting against attribute disclosure. Alternatively, sensitive information leaks may occur because while l-diversity requirement ensures â€œdiversityâ€ of sensitive values in each group, it does not recognize that values may be the semantically close, for example, an attacker could deduce a stomach disease applies to an individual if a sample containing the individual only listed three different stomach diseases.\r\nFormal definition\r\nGiven the existence of such attacks where sensitive attributes may be inferred based upon the distribution of values for l-diverse data, the t-closeness method was created to further l-diversity by additionally maintaining the distribution of sensitive fields. The paper t-Closeness: Privacy beyond k-anonymity and l-diversity (2007) defines t-closeness as being:\r\nThe t-closeness Principle: An equivalence class is said to have t-closeness if the distance between the distribution of a sensitive attribute in this class and the distribution of the attribute in the whole table is no more than a threshold t. A table is said to have t-closeness if all equivalence classes have t-closeness.\r\nAggarwal and Yu (2008) state that with this definition, threshold t gives an upper bound on the difference between the distribution of the sensitive attribute values within an anonymized group as compared to the global distribution of values. They also state that for numeric attributes, using t-closeness anonymization is more effective than many other privacy-preserving data mining methods.', NULL, '', 'Y'),

It spreads from one computer to another, leaving infections as it travels. Viruses can range in severity from causing mildly annoying effects to damaging data or software and causing denial-of-service (DoS) conditions. Almost all viruses are attached to an executable file, which means the virus may exist on a system but will not be active or able to spread until a user runs or opens the malicious host file or program. When the host code is executed, the viral code is executed as well. Normally, the host program keeps functioning after it is infected by the virus. However, some viruses overwrite other programs with copies of themselves, which destroys the host program altogether. Viruses spread when the software or document they are attached to is transferred from one computer to another using the network, a disk, file sharing, or infected e-mail attachments.\r\n\r\nWorms\r\nComputer worms are similar to viruses in that they replicate functional copies of themselves and can cause the same type of damage. In contrast to viruses, which require the spreading of an infected host file, worms are standalone software and do not require a host program or human help to propagate. To spread, worms either exploit a vulnerability on the target system or use some kind of social engineering to trick users into executing them. A worm enters a computer through a vulnerability in the system and takes advantage of file-transport or information-transport features on the system, allowing it to travel unaided.\r\n\r\nTrojans\r\nA Trojan is another type of malware named after the wooden horse the Greeks used to infiltrate Troy. It is a harmful piece of software that looks legitimate. Users are typically tricked into loading and executing it on their systems. After it is activated, it can achieve any number of attacks on the host, from irritating the user (popping up windows or changing desktops) to damaging the host (deleting files, stealing data, or activating and spreading other malware, such as viruses). Trojans are also known to create back doors to give malicious users access to the system.\r\n\r\nUnlike viruses and worms, Trojans do not reproduce by infecting other files nor do they self-replicate. Trojans must spread through user interaction such as opening an e-mail attachment or downloading and running a file from the Internet.\r\n\r\nBots\r\n\\"Bot\\" is derived from the word \\"robot\\" and is an automated process that interacts with other network services. Bots often automate tasks and provide information or services that would otherwise be conducted by a human being. A typical use of bots is to gather information (such as web crawlers), or interact automatically with instant messaging (IM), Internet Relay Chat (IRC), or other web interfaces. They may also be used to interact dynamically with websites.\r\n\r\nBots can be used for either good or malicious intent. A malicious bot is self-propagating malware designed to infect a host and connect back to a central server or servers that act as a command and control (C&C) center for an entire network of compromised devices, or \\"botnet.\\" With a botnet, attackers can launch broad-based, \\"remote-control,\\" flood-type attacks against their target(s). In addition to the worm-like ability to self-propagate, bots can include the ability to log keystrokes, gather passwords, capture and analyze packets, gather financial information, launch DoS attacks, relay spam, and open back doors on the infected host. Bots have all the advantages of worms, but are generally much more versatile in their infection vector, and are often modified within hours of publication of a new exploit. They have been known to exploit back doors opened by worms and viruses, which allows them to access networks that have good perimeter control. Bots rarely announce their presence with high scan rates, which damage network infrastructure; instead they infect networks in a way that escapes immediate notice.', NULL, 'ff27b73c524b75bcd2fa0680278f69f9', 'Y'),

In 2004 it was shown that MD5 is not collision resistant. As such, MD5 is not suitable for applications like SSL certificates or digital signatures that rely on this property for digital security. Also in 2004 more serious flaws were discovered in MD5, making further use of the algorithm for security purposes questionable; specifically, a group of researchers described how to create a pair of files that share the same MD5 checksum. Further advances were made in breaking MD5 in 2005, 2006, and 2007.

It is of interest to researchers in machine learning, pattern recognition, databases, statistics, artificial intelligence, knowledge acquisition for expert systems, and data visualization.\r\n\r\nLearn how to get started with your data\r\n\r\nThe unifying goal of the KDD process is to extract knowledge from data in the context of large databases. The knowledge discovery process is repetitive, interactive, and consists of nine steps. Note that the process is repetitive at each step, meaning one might have to move back to the previous steps. The process has many artistic aspects in the sense that one cannot present one formula or technique to classify the right choices for each step and application type. Because of this it would be better to understand the process and the different needs and possibilities for each step.\r\n\r\nThe process starts with determining the KDD goals, and ends with the implementation of the discovered knowledge. Then the loop is closed. As a result, changes would have to be made in the application domain. This closes the loop, and the effects are then measured on the new data repositories, and the KDD process is launched again.\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief description of the nine step KDD process, starting with the managerial step.\r\n\r\nStep 1\r\nDeveloping and understanding of the application domain. This is the preparatory step that sets the scene for understanding what should be done with transformation, algorithms, and representation. Those in charge of the KDD project need to understand and define the goals of the end user, then where the knowledge discovery process will take place, and other relevant prior knowledge.\r\n\r\nWork with SQL Server to store your data and create great reports\r\n\r\nAs the KDD process proceeds, there may even be a revision of this step. Having understood the KDD goals, the pre-processing of the data starts defined in the next three steps. Note that some of the methods are similar to data mining algorithms, but are used in the pre-processing context.\r\n\r\nStep 2\r\nSelecting and creating a data set on which discovery will be performed, based on goals. Determine what data will be used for the knowledge discovery, such as: what data is available, obtaining additional necessary data, and the integrating all the data for the knowledge discovery into one data set, including the attributes that will be considered for the process. This process is very important because the data mining learns and discovers from the available data. This is the evidence base for constructing the models. If some important attributes are missing, then the entire study may fail. From this respect, the more attributes considered, the better.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, to collect, organize, and operate complex data repositories is expensive, and there is a trade off with the opportunity for best understanding the phenomenon. This trade off represents an aspect with the interactive, and iterative aspect of the KDD takes place.\r\n\r\nThis starts with the best available data set, and later expands and observes the effect in terms of knowledge discovery and modeling. The three primary sources include: a data warehouse, one or more transactional data, or one or more flat tables.\r\n\r\nStep 3\r\nPre-processing and cleansing. Data reliability is enhanced in this stage. It includes data clearing, such as handling missing values, and removing of outliers.\r\n\r\nIt may involve complex statistical methods, or using a data mining algorithm in this context. For example: If one suspects that a certain attribute is of insufficient reliability, or has many missing data, then this attribute could become the goal of a data mining supervised algorithm. A prediction model for this attribute will be developed, and then missing data can be predicted. The extent to which one pays attention to this level depends on many factors. In any case, studying the aspects is important, and often revealing by itself, regarding enterprise information systems.\r\n\r\nGet started with database design today\r\n\r\nStep 4\r\nNext is data transformation. In this stage, the generation of better data, for the data mining is prepared and developed. Methods here include dimension reduction, such as feature selection, and extraction, and record sampling, and attribute transformation such as discretization of numerical attributes and functional transformation.\r\n\r\nThis step can be crucial for the success of the entire KDD project, and it is usually very project specific. For example, in medical examinations, the quotient of attributes may often be the  most important factor, and not each one by itself. In marketing we may need to consider facts beyond our control, as well as efforts and temporal issues, such as studying the effect of advertising accumulation. However, even if we do not use the right transformation at the beginning, we may obtain a surprising effect that gives a hint about the transformation needed in the next iteration.\r\n\r\nThus the KDD process reflects upon itself, and leads to an understanding of the transformation needed. Having completed the above four steps, the following four steps are related to data mining, where the focus is on the algorithmic aspects employed for each project.\r\n\r\nStep 5\r\nChoosing the appropriate data mining task. Weâ€™re now ready to decide which type of data mining to use. For example: classification, regression, or clustering. This mostly depends on the KDD goals, and also on the previous steps. There are two major goals in data mining: prediction and description. Prediction is often referred to as supervised data mining, while descriptive data mining includes the unsupervised, and visualization aspects of data mining.\r\n\r\nMost data mining techniques are based on inductive learning, where a model is constructed explicitly, or implicitly, by generalizing from a sufficient number of training examples. The underlying assumption of the inductive approach is that the trained model is applicable to future cases. The strategy also takes into account the level of meta learning for the particular set of available data.\r\n\r\nStep 6\r\nChoosing the data mining algorithm. Now that you have the strategy, we can decide which tactics to use. This stage includes selecting the specific method for searching patterns, including multiple inducers. For example, when considering precision versus understandability, the former is better with neural networks, while the latter is better with decision trees.\r\n\r\nFor each strategy of meta learning, there are several possibilities for how it can be accomplished. Meta learning focuses on explaining what causes a data mining algorithm to be successful, or not in a particular problem. Thus, this approach attempts to understand the conditions under which a data mining is most appropriate. Each algorithm has parameters, and tactics of learning. Such as tenfold cross validation, or another division for training and testing.\r\n\r\nStep 7\r\nNext is employing the data mining algorithm. Finally you can implement the appropriate data mining algorithm. In this step we might need to employ the algorithm several times until a satisfying the result is obtained. For instance, by tuning the algorithms control parameters, such as the minimum number of instances in a single leaf of a decision tree.\r\n\r\nStep 8\r\nevaluation. In this stage we evaluate and interpret the mined patterns with respect to the goals defined in the first step. Here we consider the pre-processing steps with respect to their effect on the data mining algorithm results. This step focuses on the comprehensible nature and usefulness of the induced model. In this step, the discovered knowledge is also documented for further usage.\r\n\r\nThe last step is the usage, and overall feedback on the patterns and discovery results obtained by the data mining.\r\n\r\nStep 9\r\nUsing the discovered knowledge. Weâ€™re now ready to incorporate the knowledge into another system for further action. The knowledge becomes active in the sense that we may make changes to the system, and measure the effects. Actually, the success of this step determines the effectiveness of the entire KDD process.\r\n\r\nThere are many challenges in this step, such as losing laboratory conditions under which we have operated. For instance, the knowledge was discovered from a certain static snapshot, usually a sample of the data, but now the data becomes dynamic. Data structures may change, and the data domain may be modified.', '', '1775af03d192f04b6a619564a005c5ac', 'Y'),

An Online Ad posted anywhere in the world can be viewed from anywhere in the world. Thus, an Online Advertising Campaign essentially has a worldwide audience. The medium also offers ample opportunities for posting campaigns specially designed for the areas where they would be implemented. A properly implemented campaign on the internet can do wonders for your visibility.\r\nPromptness\r\nOnline Advertising incites prompt action without the ad copy saying so. An Online Ad is clicked immediately if it is exciting enough. Thus, the response is generated on an immediate basis. Business houses all around the world will always have eloquent presentations on the importance of promptness.\r\nBetter reproductions of the creative visualizations are possible with Online Advertising. Thus, the overall impacts of the ads are much higher.\r\nMaintenance Convenience\r\nAdvertisers and publishers are well accustomed to the toil that the maintenance of ads demands. Online Advertising provides options of setting alerts on the basis of time period and events and does away with the requirement of manual inspections. Next is its ability to produce fast and accurate analyses. These data are crucial in terms of making the urgent changes even while the Online Advertising Campaign is running and improving on the ads later at the stage of conceptualization itself.\r\nLess expensive \r\nA main benefit of online advertising is that it has a much affordable price when compared with the traditional advertising costs. On the internet, you can advertise at a way more inexpensive cost for a much wider audience.\r\n\r\n\r\nWider geographical reach\r\nOnline advertising gives your campaigns global coverage, which helps your online campaigns reach more audiences. This will definitely help you achieve superior results via your online advertising strategy.\r\nNo rigorous payment\r\nThis is another appealing benefit of online advertising. In traditional advertising you have to pay the full amount of money to the advertising agency, no matter the results. In online advertising however, you have to pay only for the qualified clicks, leads or impressions.\r\nEasy result measurement\r\nThe fact that itâ€™s so easy to measure makes online advertising more appealing than the traditional advertising methods. You can find a lot of effective analytics tools in order to measure online advertising results, which helps you know what to do and what not to do in your following campaigns.\r\nMore targeted audiences\r\nIn comparison with traditional advertising, online advertising helps you to easily reach the targeted audience, which leads to your campaignâ€™s success.', NULL, '', 'Y');

The Java programming language is unusual in that a program is both compiled and interpreted. With the compiler, first you translate a program into an intermediate language called Java byte codes â€”the platform-independent codes interpreted by the interpreter on the Java platform. The interpreter parses and runs each Java byte code instruction on the computer. Compilation happens just once; interpretation occurs each time the program is executed. The following figure illustrates how this works. \r\n\r\n \r\n	\r\n	You can think of Java byte codes as the machine code instructions for the Java Virtual Machine (Java VM). Every Java interpreter, whether itâ€™s a development tool or a Web browser that can run applets, is an implementation of the Java VM. Java byte codes help make â€œwrite once, run anywhereâ€ possible. You can compile your program into byte codes on any platform that has a Java compiler. The byte codes can then be run on any implementation of the Java VM. That means that as long as a computer has a Java VM, the same program written in the Java programming language can run on Windows 2000, a Solaris workstation, or on an iMac. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Java Platform\r\nA platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs. Weâ€™ve already mentioned some of the most popular platforms like Windows 2000, Linux, Solaris, and MacOS. Most platforms can be described as a combination of the operating system and hardware. The Java platform differs from most other platforms in that itâ€™s a software-only platform that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms. \r\nThe Java platform has two components: \r\nâ€¢	The Java Virtual Machine (Java VM) \r\nâ€¢	The Java Application Programming Interface (Java API) \r\nYouâ€™ve already been introduced to the Java VM. Itâ€™s the base for the Java platform and is ported onto various hardware-based platforms. \r\nThe Java API is a large collection of ready-made software components that provide many useful capabilities, such as graphical user interface (GUI) widgets. The Java API is grouped into libraries of related classes and interfaces; these libraries are known as packages. The next section, What Can Java Technology Do? Highlights what functionality some of the packages in the Java API provide. \r\nThe following figure depicts a program thatâ€™s running on the Java platform. As the figure shows, the Java API and the virtual machine insulate the program from the hardware. \r\n \r\nNative code is code that after you compile it, the compiled code runs on a specific hardware platform. As a platform-independent environment, the Java platform can be a bit slower than native code. However, smart compilers, well-tuned interpreters, and just-in-time byte code compilers can bring performance close to that of native code without threatening portability. \r\nWhat Can Java Technology Do? \r\nThe most common types of programs written in the Java programming language are applets and applications. If youâ€™ve surfed the Web, youâ€™re probably already familiar with applets. An applet is a program that adheres to certain conventions that allow it to run within a Java-enabled browser. \r\nHowever, the Java programming language is not just for writing cute, entertaining applets for the Web. The general-purpose, high-level Java programming language is also a powerful software platform. Using the generous API, you can write many types of programs. \r\nAn application is a standalone program that runs directly on the Java platform. A special kind of application known as a server serves and supports clients on a network. Examples of servers are Web servers, proxy servers, mail servers, and print servers. Another specialized program is a servlet. A servlet can almost be thought of as an applet that runs on the server side. Java Servlets are a popular choice for building interactive web applications, replacing the use of CGI scripts. Servlets are similar to applets in that they are runtime extensions of applications. Instead of working in browsers, though, servlets run within Java Web servers, configuring or tailoring the server. \r\nHow does the API support all these kinds of programs? It does so with packages of software components that provides a wide range of functionality. Every full implementation of the Java platform gives you the following features: \r\nâ€¢	The essentials: Objects, strings, threads, numbers, input and output, data structures, system properties, date and time, and so on. \r\nâ€¢	Applets: The set of conventions used by applets. \r\nâ€¢	Networking: URLs, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Data gram Protocol) sockets, and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses. \r\nâ€¢	Internationalization: Help for writing programs that can be localized for users worldwide. Programs can automatically adapt to specific locales and be displayed in the appropriate language. \r\nâ€¢	Security: Both low level and high level, including electronic signatures, public and private key management, access control, and certificates. \r\nâ€¢	Software components: Known as JavaBeansTM, can plug into existing component architectures. \r\nâ€¢	Object serialization: Allows lightweight persistence and communication via Remote Method Invocation (RMI). \r\nâ€¢	Java Database Connectivity (JDBCTM): Provides uniform access to a wide range of relational databases. \r\nThe Java platform also has APIs for 2D and 3D graphics, accessibility, servers, collaboration, telephony, speech, animation, and more. The following figure depicts what is included in the Java 2 SDK. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow Will Java Technology Change My Life? \r\nWe canâ€™t promise you fame, fortune, or even a job if you learn the Java programming language. Still, it is likely to make your programs better and requires less effort than other languages. We believe that Java technology will help you do the following: \r\nâ€¢	Get started quickly: Although the Java programming language is a powerful object-oriented language, itâ€™s easy to learn, especially for programmers already familiar with C or C++. \r\nâ€¢	Write less code: Comparisons of program metrics (class counts, method counts, and so on) suggest that a program written in the Java programming language can be four times smaller than the same program in C++. \r\nâ€¢	Write better code: The Java programming language encourages good coding practices, and its garbage collection helps you avoid memory leaks. Its object orientation, its JavaBeans component architecture, and its wide-ranging, easily extendible API let you reuse other peopleâ€™s tested code and introduce fewer bugs. \r\nâ€¢	Develop programs more quickly: Your development time may be as much as twice as fast versus writing the same program in C++. Why? You write fewer lines of code and it is a simpler programming language than C++. \r\nâ€¢	Avoid platform dependencies with 100% Pure Java: You can keep your program portable by avoiding the use of libraries written in other languages. The 100% Pure JavaTM Product Certification Program has a repository of historical process manuals, white papers, brochures, and similar materials online. \r\nâ€¢	Write once, run anywhere: Because 100% Pure Java programs are compiled into machine-independent byte codes, they run consistently on any Java platform. \r\nâ€¢	Distribute software more easily: You can upgrade applets easily from a central server. Applets take advantage of the feature of allowing new classes to be loaded â€œon the fly,â€ without recompiling the entire program. \r\nODBC \r\nMicrosoft Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is a standard programming interface for application developers and database systems providers. Before ODBC became a de facto standard for Windows programs to interface with database systems, programmers had to use proprietary languages for each database they wanted to connect to. Now, ODBC has made the choice of the database system almost irrelevant from a coding perspective, which is as it should be. Application developers have much more important things to worry about than the syntax that is needed to port their program from one database to another when business needs suddenly change. \r\nThrough the ODBC Administrator in Control Panel, you can specify the particular database that is associated with a data source that an ODBC application program is written to use. Think of an ODBC data source as a door with a name on it. Each door will lead you to a particular database. For example, the data source named Sales Figures might be a SQL Server database, whereas the Accounts Payable data source could refer to an Access database. The physical database referred to by a data source can reside anywhere on the LAN. \r\nThe ODBC system files are not installed on your system by Windows 95. Rather, they are installed when you setup a separate database application, such as SQL Server Client or Visual Basic 4.0. When the ODBC icon is installed in Control Panel, it uses a file called ODBCINST.DLL. It is also possible to administer your ODBC data sources through a stand-alone program called ODBCADM.EXE. There is a 16-bit and a 32-bit version of this program and each maintains a separate list of ODBC data sources. \r\n\r\nFrom a programming perspective, the beauty of ODBC is that the application can be written to use the same set of function calls to interface with any data source, regardless of the database vendor. The source code of the application doesnâ€™t change whether it talks to Oracle or SQL Server. We only mention these two as an example. There are ODBC drivers available for several dozen popular database systems. Even Excel spreadsheets and plain text files can be turned into data sources. The operating system uses the Registry information written by ODBC Administrator to determine which low-level ODBC drivers are needed to talk to the data source (such as the interface to Oracle or SQL Server). The loading of the ODBC drivers is transparent to the ODBC application program. In a client/server environment, the ODBC API even handles many of the network issues for the application programmer. \r\nThe advantages of this scheme are so numerous that you are probably thinking there must be some catch. The only disadvantage of ODBC is that it isnâ€™t as efficient as talking directly to the native database interface. ODBC has had many detractors make the charge that it is too slow. Microsoft has always claimed that the critical factor in performance is the quality of the driver software that is used. In our humble opinion, this is true. The availability of good ODBC drivers has improved a great deal recently. And anyway, the criticism about performance is somewhat analogous to those who said that compilers would never match the speed of pure assembly language. Maybe not, but the compiler (or ODBC) gives you the opportunity to write cleaner programs, which means you finish sooner. Meanwhile, computers get faster every year.\r\n\r\nJDBC\r\nIn an effort to set an independent database standard API for Java; Sun Microsystems developed Java Database Connectivity, or JDBC. JDBC offers a generic SQL database access mechanism that provides a consistent interface to a variety of RDBMSs. This consistent interface is achieved through the use of â€œplug-inâ€ database connectivity modules, or drivers. If a database vendor wishes to have JDBC support, he or she must provide the driver for each platform that the database and Java run on. \r\nTo gain a wider acceptance of JDBC, Sun based JDBCâ€™s framework on ODBC. As you discovered earlier in this chapter, ODBC has widespread support on a variety of platforms. Basing JDBC on ODBC will allow vendors to bring JDBC drivers to market much faster than developing a completely new connectivity solution. \r\nJDBC was announced in March of 1996. It was released for a 90 day public review that ended June 8, 1996. Because of user input, the final JDBC v1.0 specification was released soon after. \r\nThe remainder of this section will cover enough information about JDBC for you to know what it is about and how to use it effectively. This is by no means a complete overview of JDBC. That would fill an entire book. \r\n\r\nJDBC Goals\r\nFew software packages are designed without goals in mind. JDBC is one that, because of its many goals, drove the development of the API. These goals, in conjunction with early reviewer feedback, have finalized the JDBC class library into a solid framework for building database applications in Java. \r\nThe goals that were set for JDBC are important. They will give you some insight as to why certain classes and functionalities behave the way they do. The eight design goals for JDBC are as follows: \r\n\r\n1.	SQL Level API\r\n       The designers felt that their main goal was to define a SQL interface for Java. Although not the lowest database interface level possible, it is at a low enough level for higher-level tools and APIs to be created. Conversely, it is at a high enough level for application programmers to use it confidently. Attaining this goal allows for future tool vendors to â€œgenerateâ€ JDBC code and to hide many of JDBCâ€™s complexities from the end user. \r\n2.	SQL Conformance\r\nSQL syntax varies as you move from database vendor to database vendor. In an effort to support a wide variety of vendors, JDBC will allow any query statement to be passed through it to the underlying database driver. This allows the connectivity module to handle non-standard functionality in a manner that is suitable for its users. \r\n3.	JDBC must be implemental on top of common database interfaces \r\n     The JDBC SQL API must â€œsitâ€ on top of other common SQL level APIs. This goal allows JDBC to use existing ODBC level drivers by the use of a software interface. This interface would translate JDBC calls to ODBC and vice versa. \r\n4.	Provide a Java interface that is consistent with the rest of the Java system\r\nBecause of Javaâ€™s acceptance in the user community thus far, the designers feel that they should not stray from the current design of the core Java system. \r\n5.	Keep it simple\r\nThis goal probably appears in all software design goal listings. JDBC is no exception. Sun felt that the design of JDBC should be very simple, allowing for only one method of completing a task per mechanism. Allowing duplicate functionality only serves to confuse the users of the API. \r\n6.	Use strong, static typing wherever possible\r\n      Strong typing allows for more error checking to be done at compile time; also, less error appear at runtime. \r\n7.	Keep the common cases simple\r\n      Because more often than not, the usual SQL calls used by the programmer are simple SELECTâ€™s, INSERTâ€™s, DELETEâ€™s and UPDATEâ€™s, these queries should be simple to perform with JDBC. However, more complex SQL statements should also be possible. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally we decided to proceed the implementation using Java Networking.\r\nAnd for dynamically updating the cache table we go for MS Access database.\r\n     Java ha two things: a programming language and a platform.\r\n                 Java is a high-level programming language that is all of the following \r\n\r\n			Simple			Architecture-neutral\r\n			Object-oriented		Portable\r\nDistributed 			High-performance\r\n			Interpreted			multithreaded\r\n			Robust			Dynamic\r\n			Secure\r\n		\r\nJava is also unusual in that each Java program is both compiled and interpreted. With a compile you translate a Java program into an intermediate language called Java byte codes the platform-independent code instruction is passed and run on the computer.\r\n\r\nCompilation happens just once; interpretation occurs each time the program is executed. The figure illustrates how this works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou can think of Java byte codes as the machine code instructions for the Java Virtual Machine (Java VM). Every Java interpreter, whether itâ€™s a Java development tool or a Web browser that can run Java applets, is an implementation of the Java VM. The Java VM can also be implemented in hardware.\r\n\r\n\r\nJava byte codes help make â€œwrite once, run anywhereâ€ possible. You can compile your Java program into byte codes on my platform that has a Java compiler. The byte codes can then be run any implementation of the Java VM. For example, the same Java program can run Windows NT, Solaris, and Macintosh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNetworking\r\n\r\n   TCP/IP stack\r\nThe TCP/IP stack is shorter than the OSI one:\r\n \r\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol; UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol.\r\n\r\n    IP datagramâ€™s\r\nThe IP layer provides a connectionless and unreliable delivery system. It considers each datagram independently of the others. Any association between datagram must be supplied by the higher layers. The IP layer supplies a checksum that includes its own header. The header includes the source and destination addresses. The IP layer handles routing through an Internet. It is also responsible for breaking up large datagram into smaller ones for transmission and reassembling them at the other end.\r\n\r\n  UDP\r\nUDP is also connectionless and unreliable. What it adds to IP is a checksum for the contents of the datagram and port numbers. These are used to give a client/server model - see later.\r\n\r\n\r\n   TCP\r\nTCP supplies logic to give a reliable connection-oriented protocol above IP. It provides a virtual circuit that two processes can use to communicate.\r\n   Internet addresses\r\nIn order to use a service, you must be able to find it. The Internet uses an address scheme for machines so that they can be located. The address is a 32 bit integer which gives the IP address. This encodes a network ID and more addressing. The network ID falls into various classes according to the size of the network address.\r\n   Network address\r\nClass A uses 8 bits for the network address with 24 bits left over for other addressing. Class B uses 16 bit network addressing. Class C uses 24 bit network addressing and class D uses all 32.\r\n   Subnet address\r\nInternally, the UNIX network is divided into sub networks. Building 11 is currently on one sub network and uses 10-bit addressing, allowing 1024 different hosts.\r\n   Host address\r\n8 bits are finally used for host addresses within our subnet. This places a limit of 256 machines that can be on the subnet.\r\n\r\n   Total address\r\n\r\n \r\nThe 32 bit address is usually written as 4 integers separated by dots.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Port addresses\r\nA service exists on a host, and is identified by its port. This is a 16 bit number. To send a message to a server, you send it to the port for that service of the host that it is running on. This is not location transparency! Certain of these ports are \\"well known\\".\r\n\r\n   Sockets\r\nA socket is a data structure maintained by the system to handle network connections. A socket is created using the call socket. It returns an integer that is like a file descriptor. In fact, under Windows, this handle can be used with Read File and Write File functions.\r\n#include <sys/types.h>\r\n#include <sys/socket.h>\r\nint socket(int family, int type, int protocol);\r\nHere \\"family\\" will be AF_INET for IP communications, protocol will be zero, and type will depend on whether TCP or UDP is used. Two processes wishing to communicate over a network create a socket each. These are similar to two ends of a pipe - but the actual pipe does not yet exist.\r\nJFree Chart\r\nJFreeChart is a free 100% Java chart library that makes it easy for developers to display professional quality charts in their applications. JFreeChart\\''s extensive feature set includes:\r\nA consistent and well-documented API, supporting a wide range of chart types; \r\nA flexible design that is easy to extend, and targets both server-side and client-side applications; \r\nSupport for many output types, including Swing components, image files (including PNG and JPEG), and vector graphics file formats (including PDF, EPS and SVG); \r\nJFreeChart is \\"open source\\" or, more specifically, free software. It is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL), which permits use in proprietary applications. \r\n1. Map Visualizations\r\nCharts showing values that relate to geographical areas. Some examples include: (a) population density in each state of the United States, (b) income per capita for each country in Europe, (c) life expectancy in each country of the world. The tasks in this project include:\r\nSourcing freely redistributable vector outlines for the countries of the world, states/provinces in particular countries (USA in particular, but also other areas); \r\nCreating an appropriate dataset interface (plus default implementation), a rendered, and integrating this with the existing XYPlot class in JFreeChart; \r\nTesting, documenting, testing some more, documenting some more. \r\n2. Time Series Chart Interactivity\r\n\r\nImplement a new (to JFreeChart) feature for interactive time series charts --- to display a separate control that shows a small version of ALL the time series data, with a sliding \\"view\\" rectangle that allows you to select the subset of the time series data to display in the main chart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Dashboards\r\n\r\nThere is currently a lot of interest in dashboard displays. Create a flexible dashboard mechanism that supports a subset of JFreeChart chart types (dials, pies, thermometers, bars, and lines/time series) that can be delivered easily via both Java Web Start and an applet.\r\n\r\n4. Property Editors\r\n\r\nThe property editor mechanism in JFreeChart only handles a small subset of the properties that can be set for charts. Extend (or reimplement) this mechanism to provide greater end-user control over the appearance of the charts.', '', NULL, 'Y'),

The word steganography combines the Ancient Greek words steganos (ÏƒÏ„ÎµÎ³Î±Î½ÏŒÏ‚), meaning "covered, concealed, or protected", and graphein (Î³ÏÎ¬Ï†ÎµÎ¹Î½) meaning "writing". The first recorded use of the term was in 1499 by Johannes Trithemius in his Steganographia, a treatise on cryptography and steganography, disguised as a book on magic. Generally, the hidden messages will appear to be (or be part of) something else: images, articles, shopping lists, or some other cover text. For example, the hidden message may be in invisible ink between the visible lines of a private letter. Some implementations of steganography which lack a shared secret are forms of security through obscurity, whereas key-dependent steganographic schemes adhere to Kerckhoffs''s principle.[1]\r\nThe advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messagesâ€”no matter how unbreakableâ€”will arouse interest, and may in themselves be incriminating in countries where encryption is illegal.[2] Thus, whereas cryptography is the practice of protecting the contents of a message alone, steganography is concerned with concealing the fact that a secret message is being sent, as well as concealing the contents of the message.\r\nSteganography includes the concealment of information within computer files. In digital steganography, electronic communications may include steganographic coding inside of a transport layer, such as a document file, image file, program or protocol. Media files are ideal for steganographic transmission because of their large size. For example, a sender might start with an innocuous image file and adjust the color of every 100th pixel to correspond to a letter in the alphabet, a change so subtle that someone not specifically looking for it is unlikely to notice it.\r\nPhysical\r\nSteganography has been widely used, including in recent historical times and the present day. Known examples include:\r\nâ€¢	Hidden messages within wax tablets â€” in ancient Greece, people wrote messages on the wood, then covered it with waxupon which an innocent covering message was written.\r\nâ€¢	Hidden messages on messenger''s body â€” also used in ancient Greece. Herodotus tells the story of a message tattooed on the shaved head of a slave of Histiaeus, hidden by the hair that afterwards grew over it, and exposed by shaving the head again. The message allegedly carried a warning to Greece about Persian invasion plans. This method has obvious drawbacks, such as delayed transmission while waiting for the slave''s hair to grow, and the restrictions on the number and size of messages that can be encoded on one person''s scalp.\r\nâ€¢	In the early days of the printing press, it was common to mix different typefaces on a printed page due to the printer not having enough copies of some letters otherwise. Because of this, a message could be hidden using 2 (or more) different typefaces, such as normal or italic.\r\nâ€¢	During World War II, the French Resistance sent some messages written on the backs of couriers using invisible ink.\r\nâ€¢	Hidden messages on paper written in secret inks, under other messages or on the blank parts of other messages.\r\nâ€¢	Messages written in Morse code on knitting yarn and then knitted into a piece of clothing worn by a courier.\r\nâ€¢	Jeremiah Denton repeatedly blinked his eyes in Morse Code during the 1966 televised press conference that he was forced into as an American POW by his North Vietnamese captors, spelling out the word, "T-O-R-T-U-R-E". This confirmed for the first time to the U.S. Military (naval intelligence) and Americans that American POWs were being tortured in North Vietnam.\r\nâ€¢	Messages written on envelopes in the area covered by postage stamps.\r\nâ€¢	During and after World War II, espionage agents used photographically produced microdots to send information back and forth. Microdots were typically minute, approximately less than the size of the period produced by a typewriter. World War II microdots needed to be embedded in the paper and covered with an adhesive, such as collodion. This was reflective and thus detectable by viewing against glancing light. Alternative techniques included inserting microdots into slits cut into the edge of post cards.\r\nâ€¢	During WWII, Velvalee Dickinson, a spy for Japan in New York City, sent information to accommodation addresses in neutral South America. She was a dealer in dolls, and her letters discussed the quantity and type of doll to ship. The stegotext was the doll orders, while the concealed "plaintext" was itself encoded and gave information about ship movements, etc. Her case became somewhat famous and she became known as the Doll Woman.\r\nâ€¢	Cold War counter-propaganda. In 1968, crew members of the USS Pueblo intelligence ship held as prisoners by North Korea, communicated in sign language during staged photo opportunities, informing the United States they were not defectors, but were captives of the North Koreans. In other photos presented to the US, crew members gave "the finger" to the unsuspecting North Koreans, in an attempt to discredit photos that showed them smiling and comfortable.\r\n\r\nDigital messages\r\nModern steganography entered the world in 1985 with the advent of the personal computers being applied to classical steganography problems.[5] Development following that was very slow, but has since taken off, going by the large number of steganography software available:\r\nâ€¢	Concealing messages within the lowest bits of noisy images or sound files.\r\nâ€¢	Concealing data within encrypted data or within random data. The data to be concealed are first encrypted before being used to overwrite part of a much larger block of encrypted data or a block of random data (an unbreakable cipher like theone-time pad generates ciphertexts that look perfectly random if one does not have the private key).\r\nâ€¢	Chaffing and winnowing.\r\nâ€¢	Mimic functions convert one file to have the statistical profile of another. This can thwart statistical methods that help brute-force attacks identify the right solution in aciphertext-only attack.\r\nâ€¢	Concealed messages in tampered executable files, exploiting redundancy in the targeted instruction set.\r\nâ€¢	Pictures embedded in video material (optionally played at slower or faster speed).\r\nâ€¢	Injecting imperceptible delays to packets sent over the network from the keyboard. Delays in keypresses in some applications (telnet or remote desktop software) can mean a delay in packets, and the delays in the packets can be used to encode data.\r\nâ€¢	Changing the order of elements in a set.\r\nâ€¢	Content-Aware Steganography hides information in the semantics a human user assigns to a datagram. These systems offer security against a non-human adversary/warden.\r\nâ€¢	Blog-Steganography. Messages are fractionalized and the (encrypted) pieces are added as comments of orphaned web-logs (or pin boards on social network platforms). In this case the selection of blogs is the symmetric key that sender and recipient are using; the carrier of the hidden message is the whole blogosphere.\r\nâ€¢	Modifying the echo of a sound file (Echo Steganography).[6]\r\nâ€¢	Secure Steganography for Audio Signals.[7]\r\nâ€¢	Image bit-plane complexity segmentation steganography\r\nâ€¢	Including data in ignored sections of a file, such as after the logical end of the carrier file.\r\nDigital text[edit]\r\nâ€¢	Making text the same color as the background in word processor documents, e-mails, and forum posts.\r\nâ€¢	Using Unicode characters that look like the standard ASCII character set. On most systems, there is no visual difference from ordinary text. Some systems may display the fonts differently, and the extra information would be easily spotted.\r\nâ€¢	Using hidden (control) characters, and redundant use of markup (e.g., empty bold, underline or italics) to embed information within HTML, which is visible by examining the document source. HTML pages can contain code for extra blank spaces and tabs at the end of lines, and colours, fonts and sizes, which are not visible when displayed.\r\nâ€¢	Using non-printing Unicode characters Zero-Width Joiner (ZWJ) and Zero-Width Non-Joiner (ZWNJ).[8] These characters are used for joining and disjoining letters in Arabic, but can be used in Roman alphabets for hiding information because they have no meaning in Roman alphabets: because they are "zero-width" they are not displayed. ZWJ and ZWNJ can represent "1" and "0".\r\nSocial steganography[edit]\r\nIn communities with social or government taboos or censorship, people use cultural steganography: hiding messages in idiom, pop culture references, and other messages that are shared publicly and assumed to be monitored. This relies on social context to make the underlying messages visible only to certain readers. [9][10] Examples include:\r\nâ€¢	Hiding a message in the title and context of a shared video or image\r\nâ€¢	Misspelling names or words that are popular in the media in a given week, to suggest an alternate meaning\r\nNetwork\r\nAll information hiding techniques that may be used to exchange steganograms in telecommunication networks can be classified under the general term of network steganography. This nomenclature was originally introduced by Krzysztof Szczypiorski in 2003. Contrary to the typical steganographic methods which utilize digital media (images, audio and video files) as a cover for hidden data, network steganography utilizes communication protocols'' control elements and their basic intrinsic functionality. As a result, such methods are harder to detect and eliminate. \r\nTypical network steganography methods involve modification of the properties of a single network protocol. Such modification can be applied to the PDU (Protocol Data Unit), to the time relations between the exchanged PDUs, or both (hybrid methods). \r\nMoreover, it is feasible to utilize the relation between two or more different network protocols to enable secret communication. These applications fall under the term inter-protocol steganography. \r\nNetwork steganography covers a broad spectrum of techniques, which include, among others:\r\nâ€¢	Steganophony - the concealment of messages in Voice-over-IP conversations, e.g. the employment of delayed or corrupted packets that would normally be ignored by the receiver (this method is called LACK - Lost Audio Packets Steganography), or, alternatively, hiding information in unused header fields. \r\nâ€¢	WLAN Steganography â€“ the utilization of methods that may be exercised to transmit steganograms in Wireless Local Area Networks. A practical example of WLAN Steganography is the HICCUPS system (Hidden Communication System for Corrupted Networks) \r\n\r\n\r\nalgorithm used RSA. 3DES', NULL, '', 'Y'),

Although the means to carry out, motives for, and targets of a DoS attack may vary, it generally consists of efforts to temporarily or indefinitely interrupt or suspend services of a host connected to the Internet. As clarification, DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are sent by two or more persons, or bots (see botnet). DoS (Denial of Service) attacks are sent by one person or system. As of 2014, the frequency of recognized DDoS attacks had reached an average rate of 28 per hour.[1]\r\n\r\nPerpetrators of DoS attacks typically target sites or services hosted on high-profile web servers such as banks, credit card payment gateways, and even root nameservers. DoS threats are also common in business,[2] and are sometimes responsible for website attacks.[3] This technique has now seen extensive use in certain games, used by server owners, or disgruntled competitors on games, such as server owners'' popular Minecraft servers. Increasingly, DoS attacks have also been used as a form of resistance. Richard Stallman has stated that DoS is a form of ''Internet Street Protestsâ€™.[4] The term is generally used relating to computer networks, but is not limited to this field; for example, it is also used in reference to CPU resource management.[5]\r\n\r\nOne common method of attack involves saturating the target machine with external communications requests, so much so that it cannot respond to legitimate traffic, or responds so slowly as to be rendered essentially unavailable. Such attacks usually lead to a server overload. In general terms, DoS attacks are implemented by either forcing the targeted computer(s) to reset, or consuming its resources so that it can no longer provide its intended service or obstructing the communication media between the intended users and the victim so that they can no longer communicate adequately.\r\n\r\nDenial-of-service attacks are considered violations of the Internet Architecture Board''s Internet proper use policy, and also violate the acceptable use policies of virtually all Internet service providers. They also commonly constitute violations of the laws of individual nations.', NULL, '', 'Y'),

Web site navigability is improved by the pattern based model. Cost minimized model is used in the website restructuring process. The system can be enhanced with the following features. The system can be integrated with web personalization problem. The system can be connected with web proxy caching schemes. The prediction scheme can be adopted to predict dynamic pages with query values. Dynamic page based site restructuring can be adapted with the \r\nsystem. In this paper, we have proposed a mathematical programming model to improve the navigation effectiveness of a website while minimizing changes to its current structure, a critical issue that has not been examined in the literature. Our model is particularly appropriate for informational websites whose contents are relatively stable over time. It improves a website rather than reorganizes it and hence is suitable for website maintenance on a progressive basis. The tests on a real website showed that our model could provide significant improvements to user navigation by adding only few new links. Optimal solutions were quickly obtained, suggesting that the model is very effective to real world websites. The MP model was observed to scale up very well, optimally solving large-sized problems in a few seconds in most cases on a desktop PC.To validate the performance of our model, we have defined two metrics and used them to evaluate the improved website using simulations. Our results confirmed that the improved structures indeed greatly facilitated user navigation. In addition, we found an appealing result that heavily disoriented users, i.e., those with a higher probability to abandon the website, are more likely to benefit from the improved structure than the less disoriented users. Experiment results also revealed that while using small path thresholds could result in better outcomes, it would also add significantly more new links. Thus, Webmasters need to carefully balance the trade off between desired improvements to the user navigation and the number of new links needed to accomplish the task when selecting appropriate path thresholds. Since no prior study has examined the same objective as ours, we compared our model with a heuristic instead. The comparison showed that our model could achieve comparable or better improvements than the heuristic with considerably fewer new links.', NULL, '', 'Y'),

A system virtual machine provides a complete system platform which supports the execution of a complete operating system (OS).[1] These usually emulate an existing architecture, and are built with the purpose of either providing a platform to run programs where the real hardware is not available for use (for example, executing on otherwise obsolete platforms), or of having multiple instances of virtual machines leading to more efficient use of computing resources, both in terms of energy consumption and cost effectiveness (known as hardware virtualization, the key to a cloud computing environment), or both.\r\n2.	A process virtual machine (also, language virtual machine) is designed to run a single program, which means that it supports a single process. Such virtual machines are usually closely suited to one or more programming languages and built with the purpose of providing program portability and flexibility (amongst other things).

Sweeney in a paper published in 2002 as an attempt to solve the problem: "Given person-specific field-structured data, produce a release of the data with scientific guarantees that the individuals who are the subjects of the data cannot be reidentified while the data remain practically useful." A release of data is said to have the k-anonymity property if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appear in the release. The various procedures and programs for generating anonymised data providing k-anonymity protection have been patented in the United States \r\nMethods for k-anonymization\r\nIn the context of k-anonymization problems, a database is a table with n rows and m columns. Each row of the table represents a record relating to a specific member of a population and the entries in the various rows need not be unique. The values in the various columns are the values of attributes associated with the members of the population. The following table is a nonanonymized database consisting of the patient records of some fictitious hospital in Cochin.\r\nName	Age	Gender	State of domicile	Religion	Disease\r\nRamsha	29	Female	Tamil Nadu	Hindu	Cancer\r\nYadu	24	Female	Kerala	Hindu	Viral infection\r\nSalima	28	Female	Tamil Nadu	Muslim	TB\r\nKaker	27	Male	Karnataka	Parsi	No illness\r\nJoan	24	Female	Kerala	Christian	Heart-related\r\nBahuksana	23	Male	Karnataka	Buddhist	TB\r\nRambha	19	Male	Kerala	Hindu	Cancer\r\nKishor	29	Male	Karnataka	Hindu	Heart-related\r\nJohn	17	Male	Kerala	Christian	Heart-related\r\nJohn	19	Male	Kerala	Christian	Viral infection\r\nThere are 6 attributes and 10 records in this data. There are two common methods for achieving k-anonymity for some value of k.\r\n1.	Suppression: In this method, certain values of the attributes are replaced by an asterisk ''*''. All or some values of a column may be replaced by ''*''. In the anonymized table below, we have replaced all the values in the ''Name'' attribute and all the values in the ''Religion'' attribute have been replaced by a ''*''.\r\n1.	Generalisation: In this method, individual values of attributes are replaced by with a broader category. For example, the value ''19'' of the attribute ''Age'' may be replaced by '' â‰¤ 20'', the value ''23'' by ''20 < Age â‰¤ 30'' , etc.\r\nThe next table shows the anonymized database.\r\nName	Age	Gender	State of domicile	Religion	Disease\r\n*	20 < Age â‰¤ 30	Female	Tamil Nadu	*	Cancer\r\n*	20 < Age â‰¤ 30	Female	Kerala	*	Viral infection\r\n*	20 < Age â‰¤ 30	Female	Tamil Nadu	*	TB\r\n*	20 < Age â‰¤ 30	Male	Karnataka	*	No illness\r\n*	20 < Age â‰¤ 30	Female	Kerala	*	Heart-related\r\n*	20 < Age â‰¤ 30	Male	Karnataka	*	TB\r\n*	Age â‰¤ 20	Male	Kerala	*	Cancer\r\n*	20 < Age â‰¤ 30	Male	Karnataka	*	Heart-related\r\n*	Age â‰¤ 20	Male	Kerala	*	Heart-related\r\n*	Age â‰¤ 20	Male	Kerala	*	Viral infection\r\nThis data has 2-anonymity with respect to the attributes ''Age'', ''Gender'' and ''State of domicile'' since for any combination of these attributes found in any row of the table there are always at least 2 rows with those exact attributes.

It is jointly developed  in Nokia Research Center, University of California, Santa Barbara and University of Cincinnati by C. Perkins, E. Belding-Royer and S. Das \r\nWorking \r\nIn AODV, the network is silent until a connection is needed. At that point the network node that needs a connectionbroadcasts a request for connection. Other AODV nodes forward this message, and record the node that they heard it from, creating an explosion of temporary routes back to the needy node. When a node receives such a message and already has a route to the desired node, it sends a message backwards through a temporary route to the requesting node. The needy node then begins using the route that has the least number of hops through other nodes. Unused entries in the routing tables are recycled after a time.\r\nWhen a link fails, a routing error is passed back to a transmitting node, and the process repeats.\r\nMuch of the complexity of the protocol is to lower the number of messages to conserve the capacity of the network. For example, each request for a route has a sequence number. Nodes use this sequence number so that they do not repeat route requests that they have already passed on. Another such feature is that the route requests have a "time to live" number that limits how many times they can be retransmitted. Another such feature is that if a route request fails, another route request may not be sent until twice as much time has passed as the timeout of the previous route request.\r\nThe advantage of AODV is that it creates no extra traffic for communication along existing links. Also, distance vector routing is simple, and doesn''t require much memory or calculation. However AODV requires more time to establish a connection, and the initial communication to establish a route is heavier than some other approaches.\r\nTechnical description \r\nThe AODV Routing Protocol uses an on-demand approach for finding routes, that is, a route is established only when it is required by a source node for transmitting data packets. It employs destination sequence numbers to identify the most recent path. The major difference between AODV and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) stems out from the fact that DSR uses source routing in which a data packet carries the complete path to be traversed. However, in AODV, the source node and the intermediate nodes store the next-hop information corresponding to each flow for data packet transmission. In an on-demand routing protocol, the source node floods the RouteRequest packet in the network when a route is not available for the desired destination. It may obtain multiple routes to different destinations from a single RouteRequest. The major difference between AODV and other on-demand routing protocols is that it uses a destination sequence number(DestSeqNum) to determine an up-to-date path to the destination. A node updates its path information only if theDestSeqNum of the current packet received is greater or equal than the last DestSeqNum stored at the node with smaller hopcount.\r\nA RouteRequest carries the source identifier (SrcID), the destination identifier (DestID), the source sequence number(SrcSeqNum), the destination sequence number (DestSeqNum), the broadcast identifier (BcastID), and the time to live (TTL) field. DestSeqNum indicates the freshness of the route that is accepted by the source. When an intermediate node receives a RouteRequest, it either forwards it or prepares a RouteReply if it has a valid route to the destination. The validity of a route at the intermediate node is determined by comparing the sequence number at the intermediate node with the destination sequence number in the RouteRequest packet. If a RouteRequest is received multiple times, which is indicated by the BcastID-SrcID pair, the duplicate copies are discarded. All intermediate nodes having valid routes to the destination, or the destination node itself, are allowed to send RouteReply packets to the source. Every intermediate node, while forwarding a RouteRequest, enters the previous node address and its BcastID. A timer is used to delete this entry in case a RouteReply is not received before the timer expires. This helps in storing an active path at the intermediate node as AODV does not employ source routing of data packets. When a node receives a RouteReply packet, information about the previous node from which the packet was received is also stored in order to forward the data packet to this next node as the next hop toward the destination.\r\nAdvantages and disadvantages \r\nThe main advantage of this protocol is having routes established on demand and that destination sequence numbers are applied to find the latest route to the destination. The connection setup delay is lower. One disadvantage of this protocol is that intermediate nodes can lead to inconsistent routes if the source sequence number is very old and the intermediate nodes have a higher but not the latest destination sequence number, thereby having stale entries. Also, multiple RouteReply packets in response to a single RouteRequest packet can lead to heavy control overhead. Another disadvantage of AODV is unnecessary bandwidth consumption due to periodic beaconing.', NULL, '', 'Y'),

The performance of d-Adaptor is also investigated in practical settings via simulations. Simulation results show that d-Adaptor outperforms the existing opportunistic protocols in which statistical link qualities are empirically built and the routing decisions are greedily adapted to the empirical link models. The long term average reward criterion investigated in this paper is somewhat limited in discriminating among various adaptive schemes with optimal average reward per packet. This is mostly due to the inherent dependency of the long term average reward on the tail events. To capture the performance of various adaptive schemes e.g. convergence rate, it is desirable to study the regret as defined in (12). An important area of future work comprises of developing fast converging algorithms\r\nWhich optimize the regret as a performance measure of interest. The design of routing protocols needs consideration of congestion control along with the throughput performance [19], [20]. Our work, however does not consider the issue of congestion control. Incorporating congestion control in opportunistic routing algorithms to minimize expected delay in an oblivious network is an area of future research. Last but not least, the broadcast model used in this paper assumes a decoupled operation at the MAC and network layer. While this assumption seems reasonable for many popular MAC schemes based on random access philosophy, it ignores the potentially rich interplays between scheduling and routing which arise in scheduling TDMA-based schemes.', '', '', 'Y'),

Similar to other contact based diseases in humans (e.g., SARS and H1N1) , the propagation of a BT-based virus follows a spatially localized spreading pattern. One of the most common approaches to studying such virus propagation is based on epidemic modeling. It assumes that individuals are homo generous in a host population, each of which has an equal likelihood of contact with others, . Some studies have applied epidemic modeling to analyzing the propagation dynamics of a BT-based virus. For example, studies reported in ,  and have characterized the propagation process of a BT-based virus based on the typical SI and SIR  models, respectively. Because of the limited transmission range of a Bluetooth device, human mobility plays an important role in BT-based virus propagation. Statistics from mobile service providers that   reveal the information about mobility patterns have shown that usersâ€™ mobility possesses certain social network properties. However, most of the models are, to a certain extent, simplified (e.g., using random walks in ) in characterizing human mobility Patterns, and do not consider the temporal patterns of human mobility (e.g., moving probability at a given time And inter contact times among phones (i.e., the time elapsed between two consecutive contacts between two phones)). Although Wang et al. have improved the model of a BT-based virus propagation, as reported in, by Extracting and predicting the characteristics of human mobility from real-world data traces, their model do not address the effects of operational patterns (i.e., whether or not a user clicks on an infected message) on virus propagation. On the other hand, SMS-based viruses can send copies of themselves to all phones that are recorded in address books, by means of forwarding photos, videos, and short messages, etc. The propagation of SMS-based viruses in mobile networks follows a long-range spreading pattern that is similar to the spreading of computer viruses, especially worm propagation in e-mail networks. When a user receives a suspicious message, the user normally has two options: either open or delete it. Thus, the operational behavior of users plays a key role in SMS-based virus propagation. Users with certain awareness about the risk of viruses will not likely be infected even if they receive an infected attachment from others. In order to quantitatively study SMS-based virus propagation, we need to consider certain operational patterns, such as whether or not users open a virus attachment. Although existing studies have constructed models of mobile networks based on the call records or address books of phones they do not take into account the effects of human behaviors on virus propagation. In this work, we incorporate related research on human mobility and operational behavior into our model in order to provide a computational model for characterizing and simulating the propagation dynamics of mobile viruses. The characteristics of mobility patterns described by our model are consistent with statistical results from the real-world traces, i.e., local bounded mobility areas , power-law traveling distances, and inter contact times.', '', '', 'Y'),

According to the finite-time analysis result,\r\nthe estimated ^R\r\nm;n (j) will converge to the real Rm;n (j) as\r\nstep j increases as long as sample number of each channel\r\ngrows as fast as O(lnT) [11].\r\nThe notations are given below:\r\nXm;n (j): number of times for which secondary user m\r\nhas successfully accessed channel n in time slot j.\r\nYm;n (j): number of times for which secondary user m\r\nhas selected channel n in time slot j.\r\nCm;n (j): capability of channel n to which secondary user\r\nm has accessed in time slot j.\r\n^R\r\nm;n (j): estimated channel reward of secondary user m\r\nin channel n in time slot j.\r\nThe order-optimal learning algorithm is given below:\r\n- Initialization: At the beginning of each time slot, each\r\nsecondary user senses every channel once.\r\n- Loop: The secondary user chooses the channel that\r\nmaximizes the reward ^R\r\nm;n (j), then updates Xm;n (j),\r\nYm;n (j) and Cm;n (j) after each accessing.\r\n^R\r\nm;n (j) =\r\nô€€€Xm;n (j)\r\nYm;n (j)\r\n\r\n+\r\ns\r\n2lnj\r\nYm;n (j)\r\n\r\n Cm;n (j)\r\n(9)\r\nThe learning algorithm can achieve the logarithmic regret\r\nuniformly over the iteration number j without any knowledge\r\nabout the reward distribution.

In order to realize the distributed\r\nalgorithm, we set back-off timers to implement a rejection\r\nmechanism, which does not need information sharing in a\r\ncentral node. The OLGS solution is described below.\r\n1) Initially: Set the monotonically decreasing function\r\nT = f(R) and calculate back-off timers in light of\r\nf(R), t=0, Ym;n(1) =1, Xm;n(1) =1, Cm;n(1) =1, j=1.\r\nFor the secondary user m, set a(m)=0, done(m)=0,\r\n(m = 1; : : : ;M).\r\nFor the primary channel n, set idle(n)=0, c(n)=0,\r\n(n = 1; : : : ;N).\r\nthe channel utility Rm;n (1) = 1=N; 8m 2 M; n 2\r\nf1; : : : ;Ng.\r\n2) At the beginning of each time slot, secondary user m\r\ncalculates and sets the back-off timer\r\nftimer(Rm;n (j)) j m; ng(m = 1; : : : ;M; n = 1; : : : ;N)\r\nin light of the function T = f(R).\r\n3) At every time t when a back-off timer expires, t 2\r\nftimer(Rm;n (j)) j m; ng do:\r\nFor secondary user m s.t. done(m)=0 selects channel\r\nn\r\nm(t), where n\r\nm(t) is determined by:\r\nn\r\nm(t) = fn j timer(Rm;n (j)) = tg:\r\nThat is, n\r\nm(t) is the channel that leads to an unexpired\r\nminimal back-off timer or the residual maximal channel\r\nreward. Ym;n\r\nm(t)(j) = Ym;n\r\nm(t)(j) + 1.\r\n4) If idle(n\r\nm(t))=1 and c(n\r\nm(t))=0, then a(m) = n\r\nm(t),\r\ndone(m) = 1;Xm;n\r\nm(t)(j) = Xm;n\r\nm(t)(j) + 1.\r\nThat is, if the selected channel n\r\nm(t) is idle and\r\nno collisions among secondary users on this channel,\r\nsecondary user m access channel n\r\nm(t) and get the\r\nchannel transmission rate Cm;n\r\nm(t)(j).\r\n5) If idle(n\r\nm(t))=0 or c(n\r\nm(t))=1, then done(m)=0, exclude n\r\nm(t) from the channel set N, then go to step(3).\r\nThat is, if the selected channel n\r\nm(t) is busy or has\r\ncollision among secondary users over this channel,\r\nsecondary user m excludes n\r\nm(t) from the channel set\r\nN then go to step (3) to update n\r\nm(t) until finding\r\nsuitable channel.\r\n6) At the end of the jth slot, secondary user m updates\r\n^R\r\nm;n (j) =\r\nô€€€Xm;n (j)\r\nYm;n (j)\r\n\r\n+\r\ns\r\n2lnj\r\nYm;n (j)\r\n\r\n Cm;n (j)\r\nas : Cm;n (j) =\r\nXj\r\nt=1\r\nCm;n (t)=j:\r\nSecondary user updates each channel utility related\r\nwith successful access probability and average channel\r\ncapability.\r\n7) Go to step (3) and repeat the process.\r\nIV. SIMULATION RESULTS\r\nWe conduct simulation experiments with MATLAB software\r\nto evaluate the system throughput and the convergence\r\nrate of the OLGS scheme. The simulation results are shown\r\nin Fig. 3 and 4. Several algorithms are compared: optimal,\r\nrandom, order-optimal learning, and the OLGS algorithm. The\r\noptimal algorithm serves as an upper bound of the achievable\r\nthroughput where a central controller implements exhaustive\r\nsearching under ideal assumptions of known system parameters.\r\nThe random allocation scheme is that secondary users access\r\nan arbitrary channel with equal probability. In the orderoptimal\r\nalgorithm, secondary users learn unknown channel\r\nparameters but randomly access a channel after sensing. The\r\nOLGS algorithm is different from other schemes in which\r\nit achieves a stable one-to-one user-channel matching with a\r\ncollision-free mechanism among secondary users.', '', '', 'Y'),

Slicing \r\nTo improve the current state of the art in this paper, we introduce a novel data anonymization technique called slicing [1]. \r\nSlicing partitions the data set both vertically and horizontally. Vertical partitioning is done by grouping attributes into \r\ncolumns based on the correlations among the attributes. Each column contains a subset of attributes that are highly \r\ncorrelated. Horizontal partitioning is done by grouping tuples into buckets. Finally, within each bucket, values in each \r\ncolumn are randomly permutated (or sorted) to break the linking between different columns. The basic idea of slicing is \r\nto break the association cross columns, but to preserve the association within each column. This reduces the \r\ndimensionality of the data and preserves better utility than generalization and bucketization. \r\nSlicing preserves utility because it groups highly correlated attributes together, and preserves the correlations between \r\nsuch attributes. Slicing protects privacy because it breaks the associations between uncorrelated attributes, which are \r\ninfrequent and thus identifying. Note that when the data set contains QIs and one SA, bucketization has to break their \r\ncorrelation; slicing, on the other hand, can group some QI attributes with the SA, preserving attribute correlations with \r\nthe sensitive attribute. \r\nThe key intuition that slicing provides privacy protection is that the slicing process ensures that for any tuple, there are \r\ngenerally multiple matching buckets. Slicing first partitions attributes into columns. Each column contains a subset of \r\nattributes. Slicing also partition tuples into buckets. Each bucket contains a subset of tuples. This horizontally partitions \r\nthe table. Within each bucket, values in each column are randomly permutated to break the linking between different \r\ncolumns. \r\nTuple Partitioning \r\nThe algorithm maintains two data structures: 1) a queue of buckets Q and 2) a set of sliced buckets SB. Initially, Q \r\ncontains only one bucket which includes all tuples and SB is empty. For each iteration, the algorithm removes a bucket \r\nfrom Q and splits the bucket into two buckets [5]. If the sliced table after the split satisfies l-diversity, then the algorithm \r\nputs the two buckets at the end of the queue Q Otherwise, we cannot split the bucket anymore and the algorithm puts the \r\nbucket into SB.When Q becomes empty, we have computed the sliced table. The set of sliced buckets is SB.', NULL, '', 'Y'),

The Gale-Shapley spectrum sharing provides a one-to-one user-channel matching policy to avoid collisions among secondary users. The order-optimal learning algorithm implements the stable spectral matching without prior channel knowledge and mass information exchange. Simulation results demonstrated that about 95% of the optimal rate is achieved by the stable matching for collision-free spatio-spectral reuse in an asymmetrical network. The OLGS scheme improves system throughput with fast convergence\r\nand achieves logarithmic regret over time.

This is because the high volume of data cannot be handled by one computer alone. In the past, mainframes were used for processes involving big bulks of data. Mainframes were giant computers housed in big rooms to be used for critical applications involving lots of data used as in processes involving census, consumer statistics, enterprise resource planning or financial transaction processing.\r\nIT professionals have found more advantages with having a distributed computing method to process different parts of a program simultaneously on several computers connected on a network. With many computers working can exceed the processing speed of mainframe computers.\r\nIn todayâ€™s business environment, data management has become a critical part of a company. Many customers and company staff use a combination of laptops, desktops and terminal services. This has posed serious challenges to many data administrators to make user data available to data consumers in a consistent and timely fashion.\r\nMaking use of data distribution partially answers these challenges. Data distribution may at first give the impression of contradiction to data normalization which is a relational database process of eliminating redundant data to speed up computer processing and save company expenses by saving on expensive storage devices. Because data distribution is basically a way of replicating data, it could give the impression of defeating the purpose of database normalization.\r\nIn data distribution replicated data are stored in another computer database which are normalized. It could be a mirror of a database in another computer system. In distributed systems, several computers process a program using its own data from its own database and these computers continuously update each other to synchronize their data content. This is useful in several ways. On the one hand, sharing processing load could mean faster and more efficient computing.\r\nOn the other hand, employing a distributed computing system could mean less prone to failure. If one of the computers within the distributed system fails, another one can carry out the same load. In contrast to centralized computing as in the case of mainframes, if the mainframe computer breaks down, the whole system goes down as well.\r\nAs a result, business operations could come to a halt until the mainframe is fixed. Or the company might temporarily switch to non automated system while waiting from the mainframe computer to go up again. The toll on this non automated system could fall on the system administrator because his work could pile up due to the bulk of data accumulated during the non automated period.\r\nData could be transferred when it has reached a particular volume. This is sometime referred to as batch transferring but is more commonly known as data deployment. A bulk of data is distributed by batch from one site to another.\r\nA data distribution service (DDS) is a specification of publish / subscribe middleware for distributed systems. Specifically, a DDS handle processes related to transfers of data including data addressing, data marshalling and de-marshalling. Any node within the system can be a publisher, subscriber or both at the same time.\r\nData distribution can be costly undertaking but when properly managed, it could be very beneficial to a company implementing a data warehouse.', NULL, '', 'Y'),

Database publishing can be incorporated into larger workflows as a component, where documents are created, approved, revised and released.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is using database contents like article and price information to fill out pre-formatted template documents. Templates are typically created in a normal desktop layout application where certain boxes or text are designated as placeholders. These placeholders are then targeted with new content which flows in from the database. This allows for quick generation of final output and, in case of changes to the database, quickly perform updates, with limited or no manual intervention.\r\n\r\nAnother model of database publishing is found in many Web-to-Print solutions where users browse templates from an online catalog (e.g. Business Cards, Brochures, etc.), personalize the selected template by filling in a form and then view the rendered result. In this case the initial source of data is from user input, but it is captured in a database so that if the same user revisits the site later, they can resume editing where they left off. The form is then pre-filled from the database-stored variables the user entered before.\r\n\r\nThe main layout applications for this workflow are: Datalogics Pager, Adobe FrameMaker / InDesign, QuarkXPress, Xyvision and Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher (formerly 3B2). Generally, these layout applications have a corresponding server version, which receives commands via web interfaces rather than desktop interaction. QuarkXPress Server and Adobe InDesign Server both take full advantage of the design features available in their respective desktop versions.\r\n\r\nThese applications make their broad spectrum of features available for extension and integration with vertical solutions, that can be developed either internally, through some form of scripting (e.g. JavaScript or AppleScript for InDesign), or externally, through some API and corresponding developer kits. Numerous developers have created complete or partial vertical solutions around the rendering capabilities of the server applications.\r\n\r\nOther variants of database publishing are the rendering of content for direct PDF output. This approach prevents manual intervention on the final output, since PDF is not (comfortably) editable. This may not be perceived as a limitation in situations like report generation where manual editability is not needed or not desired.', '', '', 'Y'),

Usually, each information source gets its dedicated area on the page for displaying information (a portlet); often, the user can configure which ones to display. Variants of portals include Mashup (web application hybrid) and intranet "dashboards" for executives and managers. The extent to which content is displayed in a "uniform way" may depend on the intended user and the intended purpose, as well as the diversity of the content. Very often design emphasis is on a certain "metaphor" for configuring and customizing the presentation of the content and the chosen implementation framework and/or code libraries. In addition, the role of the user in an organization may determine which content can be added to the portal or deleted from the portal configuration.\r\nA portal may use a search engine API to permit users to search intranet content as opposed to extranet content by restricting which domains may be searched. Apart from this common search engines feature, web portals may offer other services such as e-mail, news, stock quotes, information from databases and even entertainment content. Portals provide a way for enterprises and organizations to provide a consistent look and feel with access control and procedures for multiple applications and databases, which otherwise would have been different web entities at various URLs. The features available may be restricted by whether access is by an authorized and authenticated user (employee, member) or an anonymous site visitor.Example of early public bookportalswere AOL, Excite, Netvibes, iGoogle, MSN, Naver, Indiatimes, Rediff, Sify and Yahoo!. See for example, the "My Yahoo!" feature of Yahoo! which may have inspired such features as the later Google "iGoogle" (discontinued as of November 1, 2013.) The configurable side-panels of, for example, the modern Opera browser and the option of "Speed Dial" pages by most browsers continue to reflect the earlier "portal" metaphor.', NULL, '', 'Y'),

Typical context-oriented information is information on source location, sink location and timing of events. This kind of information can be usually obtained by an external adversary using traffic analysis techniques. We summarize state-of-the-art protections in the following subsections.\r\n\r\nLocation Privacy:\r\nLocation privacy is extremely important in WSNs. Information on location of events or on location of base stations can be of a primary concern of an adversary. Suppose the Panda-Hunter Game where a WSN is employed to monitor endangered pandas in their habitat. It is sufficient for the adversary to find out location of sensors currently monitoring the panda to successfully localize and capture the panda. Similarly, the adversary only needs to find out location of the base station to be able to mount a physical or other DoS attack on the base station and thus inactivate the whole network. There are two basic types of adversaries considered when evaluating the location privacy â€“ local adversary and global adversary. The local adversary has limited radio range and is able to monitor traffic only in a small part of the network at a time. On the contrary, the global adversary is capable of monitoring the whole network at a time and is able to immediately localize all transmitting nodes.\r\n\r\nTemporal Privacy:\r\nIn addition to location, sensitive contextual information that can be inferred by an external adversary is timing of monitored events or a message rate. A clever adversary may abuse such information for example for victim tracking. Knowing the time and place of the message creation, she can estimate the victim movements. The problem of temporal information protection is referred to as the temporal privacy. The concept of the temporal privacy in WSNs. They have formalized the problem and proposed the Rate-Controlled Adaptive Delaying (RCAD) to protect the temporal privacy. In the RCAD, every node buffers an incoming message and randomly delays its retransmission according to the exponential distribution. Buffer preemption strategy is included to cope with the problem of overloaded buffers. When the node buffer is full, this strategy chooses a message to be transmitted immediately without further delay. Several such strategies are proposed and evaluated in. The RCAD is suitable for WSN applications where a reasonable delay can be tolerated. Note that also schemes protecting location privacy have the potential to protect the temporal privacy.the monitored subject privacy and vice versa. Privacy in WSNs can be classified into two categories â€“ content-oriented privacy and context-oriented privacy.\r\nContent-oriented privacy is threatened by an adversary who aims to manipulate and/or read the content of messages sent over a WSN. In contrast, context-oriented privacy is concerned about a protection of contextual information surrounding the content. Typical contextual information is location where the data has been sensed or time of the measurement.\r\n\r\nData Privacy:\r\nData privacy protections target privacy of data collected by a network and queries posted to a network. There are two types of adversaries threatening the data privacy â€“ external adversary and internal adversary. The external adversary only eavesdrops communication in a network. This kind of adversary can be easily defeated by encryption techniques such as SPINS or pDCS. On the other hand, the internal adversary controls one or more nodes and usually has an access to encryption keys of these nodes. In such a case, the easiest way to protect privacy of data sent from nodes to the base station is to use end-to-end encryption based on keys shared between the sending node and the base station.Many of them are based on the random walks and introduce time delays as well. Furthermore, the Periodic Collection scheme, where the sending rate is constant among the whole network, seems to provide the optimal temporal privacy, a because the traffic is independent of the event occurrence. \r\n\r\nPrivacy-Preserving Health Data Collection for Preschool Children\r\nSearch Me If You Can:Privacy-preserving Location Query Service\r\nEnhancing Privacy Preservation of Anonymous Location Sampling Techniques in Trafï¬c Monitoring Systems\r\nAPPLAUS: A Privacy-Preserving Location Proof Updating System for Location-based Services Trajectory Privacy in Location-based Services and Data Publication', NULL, '', 'Y');

The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early ''80s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.\r\nDigital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil (as part of the electronic discovery process) courts. Forensics may also feature in the private sector; such as during internal corporate investigations or intrusion investigation (a specialist probes into the nature and extent of an unauthorized network intrusion).\r\nThe technical aspect of an investigation is divided into several sub-branches, relating to the type of digital devices involved; computer forensics, network forensics, forensic data analysis and mobile device forensics. The typical forensic process encompasses the seizure, forensic imaging (acquisition) and analysis of digital media and the production of a report into collected evidence.\r\nAs well as identifying direct evidence of a crime, digital forensics can be used to attribute evidence to specific suspects, confirm alibis or statements, determine intent, identify sources (for example, in copyright cases), or authenticate documents. Investigations are much broader in scope than other areas of forensic analysis (where the usual aim is to provide answers to a series of simpler questions) often involving complex time-lines or hypotheses.', NULL, '', 'Y'),

Techniques such as repeating background images mean that one small image can be downloaded from the web server only once and then be instructed (via a CSS) to repeat by the markup language, shifting the work load from the web server onto the client''s computer.

Slicing \r\nTo improve the current state of the art in this paper, we introduce a novel data anonymization technique called slicing [1]. \r\nSlicing partitions the data set both vertically and horizontally. Vertical partitioning is done by grouping attributes into \r\ncolumns based on the correlations among the attributes. Each column contains a subset of attributes that are highly \r\ncorrelated. Horizontal partitioning is done by grouping tuples into buckets. Finally, within each bucket, values in each \r\ncolumn are randomly permutated (or sorted) to break the linking between different columns. The basic idea of slicing is \r\nto break the association cross columns, but to preserve the association within each column. This reduces the \r\ndimensionality of the data and preserves better utility than generalization and bucketization. \r\nSlicing preserves utility because it groups highly correlated attributes together, and preserves the correlations between \r\nsuch attributes. Slicing protects privacy because it breaks the associations between uncorrelated attributes, which are \r\ninfrequent and thus identifying. Note that when the data set contains QIs and one SA, bucketization has to break their \r\ncorrelation; slicing, on the other hand, can group some QI attributes with the SA, preserving attribute correlations with \r\nthe sensitive attribute. \r\nThe key intuition that slicing provides privacy protection is that the slicing process ensures that for any tuple, there are \r\ngenerally multiple matching buckets. Slicing first partitions attributes into columns. Each column contains a subset of \r\nattributes. Slicing also partition tuples into buckets. Each bucket contains a subset of tuples. This horizontally partitions \r\nthe table. Within each bucket, values in each column are randomly permutated to break the linking between different \r\ncolumns.', NULL, '', 'Y'),

Undoubtedly, the advent of these connections has impacted all aspects of our lives. The decentralized nature of the internet forms its very foundation, yet ironically, this nature has opened networks and individual machines to a host of threats and attacks from cyber-criminals. Cyber-crime includes, but is not limited to, the theft of trade secrets, theft of or destruction of intellectual property and fraud. Trade secrets and intellectual property is typically the foundation upon which many companies are built. \r\nThis information gives each company a competitive advantage and to have such information compromised in any way could easily cost the company millions. In addition, since money is no longer exclusively paper based due to online trading, financial fraud such as credit card misuse is propagated once a criminal gains access to enterprise information systems. Cyber obscenity is one of the more popular forms of cyber crime. Essentially, pornographic material, such as child pornography, is hidden on storage media since perpetrators acknowledge the illegality of being in possession of these images. \r\nCyber-criminals associate themselves with one of or all of these crimes by making it their jobs to find vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications or services that run on a computer connected to the internet. Once vulnerability is discovered and exploited, the criminal is able to view or store sensitive information on some form of storage media. The storage medium can either be local, i.e. hard-drives or removable, i.e. floppy disks, zip drives, memory sticks or CDs. Once the crime is committed, prosecution becomes extremely difficult since the crime venue could easily be in different cities and countries and involve unsuspecting third parties. \r\nAt this point, a computer forensic specialist (CFS) is tasked to investigate the digital crime scene by impartially scrutinizing a number of digital sources that are either involved or thought to be involved in the crime, and ultimately produce a single document reflecting a summary of the contents of the digital source.', NULL, '', 'Y'),

Generally, clicking does not correlate well with purchasing. This complements prior studies showing evidence that few clicks lead to actual product purchases  and that most clicks are generated by a very small subset of browsers.\r\nMore importantly, clicks are unsuitable as a criterion for designing and optimizing targeting strategies (i.e., `finding the best browsers to show an ad to''). Targeting models built on clicks do a poor job of identifying browsers who later will purchase. This is very consistent with the results of a recent study . In our study, generalizing across all the campaigns, the targeting 2 In order to be able to perform the comparison we use campaigns for which conversions are available. These results may generalize to campaigns for which conversions are not available for one or more of the reasons discussed above. performance of click-driven models is statistically indistinguishable from random guessing! But is it really the `click'' that is at fault? That question is much harder to answer and also relates to the generalizability of our results. Clearly, the correlation between the click and the purchase depends on the creative design. We suspect that we observe here the results of years of the bad habit of click optimization in the industry. Some creatives are clearly designed to entice the click (e.g., ashy, promising to win something, etc.)|at times at the expense of the brand message .After all, if evaluation is by CTR, the `best'' creative is the one that was clicked on the most, no matter by whom.', NULL, '', 'Y'),

This paper proposes ToF, a general transformation-based optimization framework for workflows in the cloud. Specifically, ToF formulates six basic workflow transformation operations. An arbitrary performance and cost optimization process can be represented as a transformation plan (i.e., a sequence of basic transformation operations). All transformations form a huge optimization space. We further develop a cost model guided planner to efficiently find the optimized transformation for a predefined goal (e.g., minimizing the monetary cost with a given performance requirement). We develop ToF on real cloud environments including Amazon EC2 and Rackspace. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ToF in optimizing the performance and cost in comparison with other existing approaches.', '', '', '', NULL, '', '', '2014-06-04 00:00:00', 'Y'),

To evaluate their performance, many works have been carried out on testbeds or simulation platforms. However, till now, there is a lack of accurate theoretical models to analyze the performance for these protocols. In an effort to fill this gap, we present a Markov chain-based analytical model in this paper to model these PS protocols, with its focus on multicast services in wireless LANs. The proposed analytical model successfully captures the key characteristic of the power saving system: the data delivery procedure starts periodically at the previously negotiated time, but ends at a rather random time with its distribution depending on the end time of data delivery in the last delivery period as well as the arrival rate of incoming traffic. In the situations with light to moderate traffic loads and under the Poisson assumption for incoming traffic, the amount of data delivered between consecutive delivery periods possesses the Markov property, which builds up our Markov chain-based model. For incoming traffic with long-range dependence (LRD), a multistate Markov-Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP) is used to approximate the traffic, making the analytical model valid in more general cases. We verify our model by simulations on ns2 and the results show that the model can faithfully predict the performance of these PS protocols over a wide variety of testing scenarios.', '', '', '', NULL, '', '', '2014-06-05 00:00:00', 'Y'),

This has contributed to the big data problem faced by the industry due to the inability of conventional database systems and software tools to manage or process the big data sets within tolerable time limits.

For some applications under an appropriate size of training set, the proposed model allows artificial enlargement of the training set by including a certain number of transformed shapes for transformation invariance, and then the model remains jointly convex and can handle the case of overlapping or multiple objects presented in an image within a small range.

Many cases of these applications rely on the\r\ninformation of personal locations, for example, surveillance\r\nand location systems. These location-dependent systems are\r\nrealized by using either identity sensors or counting\r\nsensors. For identity sensors, for example, Bat [1] and\r\nCricket [2], each individual has to carry a signal sender/\r\nreceiver unit with a globally unique identifier. With identity\r\nsensors, the system can pinpoint the exact location of each\r\nmonitored person. On the other hand, counting sensors, for\r\nexample, photoelectric sensors [3], [4], and thermal sensors\r\n[5], are deployed to report the number of persons located in\r\ntheir sensing areas to a server.\r\nUnfortunately, monitoring personal locations with a\r\npotentially untrusted system poses privacy threats to the\r\nmonitored individuals, because an adversary could abuse\r\nthe location information gathered by the system to infer\r\npersonal sensitive information [2], [6], [7], [8]. For the\r\nlocation monitoring system using identity sensors, the sensor\r\nnodes report the exact location information of the monitored\r\npersons to the server; thus using identity sensors immediately\r\nposes a major privacy breach. To tackle such a privacy\r\nbreach, the concept of aggregate location information, that is, a\r\ncollection of location data relating to a group or category of\r\npersons from which individual identities have been removed\r\n[8], [9], has been suggested as an effective approach to\r\npreserve location privacy [6], [8], [9]. Although the counting\r\nsensors by nature provide aggregate location information,\r\nthey would also pose privacy breaches.\r\nFig. 1 gives an example of a privacy breach in a location\r\nmonitoring system with counting sensors. There are\r\n11 counting sensor nodes installed in nine rooms R1 to R9,\r\nand two hallways C1 and C2 (Fig. 1a). The nonzero number of\r\npersons detected by each sensor node is depicted as a number\r\nin parentheses. Figs. 1b and 1c give the numbers reported by\r\nthe same set of sensor nodes at two consecutive time instances\r\ntiÃ¾1 and tiÃ¾2, respectively.

Then, the\r\nadversary knows that Alice left R3 at time tiÃ¾1 and went to C2\r\nby knowing the number of persons detected by the sensor\r\nnodes in R3 and C2. Likewise, the adversary can infer that\r\nAlice left C2 at time tiÃ¾2 and went to R7. Such knowledge\r\nleakage may lead to several privacy threats. For example,\r\nknowing that a person has visited certain clinical rooms may\r\nlead to knowing the her health records.

An intriguing development as it is, the operational challenge in previous video sharing systems persists, em i.e., the large server cost demanded for scaling of the systems. Peer-to-peer video sharing could be a rescue, only if the video viewers'' mutual resource contribution has been fully incentivized and efficiently scheduled. Exploring the unique advantages of a social network based video sharing system, we advocate to utilize social reciprocities among peers with social relationships for efficient contribution incentivization and scheduling, so as to enable high-quality video streaming with low server cost. We exploit social reciprocity with two give-and-take ratios at each peer: (1) peer contribution ratio (em PCR), which evaluates the reciprocity level between a pair of social friends, and (2) system contribution ratio (em SCR), which records the give-and-take level of the user to and from the entire system. We design efficient peer-to-peer mechanisms for video streaming using the two ratios, where each user optimally decides which other users to seek relay help from and help in relaying video streams, respectively, based on combined evaluations of their social relationship and historical reciprocity levels. Our design achieves effective incentives for resource contribution, load balancing among relay peers, as well as efficient social-aware resource scheduling.

A promising application of ABE is flexible access control of encrypted data stored in the cloud, using access polices and ascribed attributes associated with private keys and ciphertexts. One of the main efficiency drawbacks of the existing ABE schemes is that decryption involves expensive pairing operations and the number of such operations grows with the complexity of the access policy. Recently, Green et al. proposed an ABE system with outsourced decryption that largely eliminates the decryption overhead for users. In such a system, a user provides an untrusted server, say a cloud service provider, with a transformation key that allows the cloud to translate any ABE ciphertext satisfied by that user''s attributes or access policy into a simple ciphertext, and it only incurs a small computational overhead for the user to recover the plaintext from the transformed ciphertext. Security of an ABE system with outsourced decryption ensures that an adversary (including a malicious cloud) will not be able to learn anything about the encrypted message; however, it does not guarantee the correctness of the transformation done by the cloud. In this paper, we consider a new requirement of ABE with outsourced decryption: verifiability. Informally, verifiability guarantees that a user can efficiently check if the transformation is done correctly. We give the formal model of ABE with verifiable outsourced decryption and propose a concrete scheme. We prove that our new scheme is both secure and verifiable, without relying on random oracles.

A great deal of effort has been devoted to the extraction of low-level visual features, such as color, shape, texture, and motion for characterizing and retrieving video shots. However, the accuracy of these feature descriptors is still far from satisfaction due to the well-known semantic gap. In order to alleviate the problem, this paper investigates a novel methodology of representing and retrieving video shots using human-centric high-level features derived in brain imaging space (BIS) where brain responses to natural stimulus of video watching can be explored and interpreted. At first, our recently developed dense individualized and common connectivity-based cortical landmarks (DICCCOL) system is employed to locate large-scale functional brain networks and their regions of interests (ROIs) that are involved in the comprehension of video stimulus. Then, functional connectivities between various functional ROI pairs are utilized as BIS features to characterize the brain''s comprehension of video semantics. Then an effective feature selection procedure is applied to learn the most relevant features while removing redundancy, which results in the formation of the final BIS features. Afterwards, a mapping from low-level visual features to high-level semantic features in the BIS is built via the Gaussian process regression (GPR) algorithm, and a manifold structure is then inferred, in which video key frames are represented by the mapped feature vectors in the BIS. Finally, the manifold-ranking algorithm concerning the relationship among all data is applied to measure the similarity between key frames of video shots.

Netw., vol. 15, no. 4, pp. 824ï¿½837, Aug. 2007), existence and uniqueness of equilibrium of heterogeneous protocols are investigated. This paper extends the study with two objectives: analyzing the optimality and stability of such networks and designing control schemes to improve those properties. First, we demonstrate the intricate behavior of a heterogeneous network through simulations and present a framework to help understand its equilibrium properties. Second, we propose a simple source-based algorithm to decouple bandwidth allocation from router parameters and flow arrival patterns by only updating a linear parameter in the sources'' algorithms on a slow timescale. It steers a network to the unique optimal equilibrium. The scheme can be deployed incrementally as the existing protocol needs no change and only new protocols need to adopt the slow timescale adaptation.', '', '', '', NULL, '', '', '2014-06-05 00:00:00', 'Y'),

Although significant efforts have been made to facilitate face tracking or illumination normalization in unconstrained videos, the approaches developed may not be effective in video surveillance applications. This is because: 1) a low-resolution face contains limited information, and 2) major changes in illumination on a small region of the face make the tracking ineffective. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes to perform tracking in an illumination-insensitive feature space, called the gradient logarithm field (GLF) feature space. The GLF feature mainly depends on the intrinsic characteristics of a face and is only marginally affected by the lighting source. In addition, the GLF feature is a global feature and does not depend on a specific face model, and thus is effective in tracking low-resolution faces. Experimental results show that the proposed GLF-based tracker works well under significant illumination changes and outperforms many state-of-the-art tracking algorithms.', '', '', '', NULL, '', '', '2014-06-05 00:00:00', 'Y'),

An effective method for securely transmitting images is found in the field of Visual Cryptography (VC). Visual cryptography scheme is a cryptographic technique which allows visual information (e.g. printed text, handwritten notes, and images etc) to be encrypted in such a way that the decryption can be performed by the human visual system(HVS), without the aid of computers. The shares are safe because separately they reveal nothing about the secret image. A distinctive property of visual cryptography scheme is that one can visually decode the secret image by superimposing shares .By taking advantage of this property, third person can easily retrieve the secret image if shares are passing in sequence over the network. This paper presents a visual cryptographic technique for color images in which the generated shares are again encrypted. For this XOR operation is used and this will provide double security for the secret document. Thus secret shares are not available in their actual form for any alteration by the adversaries who try to create fake shares.

In addition to utilizing the earth mover''s distance (EMD) as the distance measure of our color features, we also devise an efficient and effective distance measure, comparing histograms by clustering (CHIC). Moreover, the efficient implementation of our extraction methods is explored. With slight modification of the BQMP algorithm, our extraction methods are equipped with the capability of exploiting the concurrent property of hardware implementation. The experimental results show that our hardware implementation can achieve approximately a second order of magnitude improvement over the software implementation. It is noted that minimizing the distortion incurred in the extraction process can enhance the accuracy of the subsequent various image applications, and we evaluate the meaningfulness of the new extraction methods by the application to content-based image retrieval (CBIR).

However, most existing resource discovery mechanisms rely mainly on recent observations to achieve scalability in large systems. In this paper, we propose the notion of a resource bundle-a representative resource usage distribution for a group of nodes with similar resource usage patterns-that employs two complementary techniques to overcome the limitations of existing techniques: resource usage histograms to provide statistical guarantees for resource capacities and clustering-based resource aggregation to achieve scalability. Using trace-driven simulations and data analysis of a month-long PlanetLab trace, we show that resource bundles are able to provide high accuracy for statistical resource discovery, while achieving high scalability.

Conventional derivative filters often suffer from an undesired merging of adjacent objects because of their intrinsic usage of an inappropriately broad Gaussian kernel; as a result, neighboring structures cannot be properly resolved. To avoid this problem, we propose to replace the low-level Gaussian kernel with a bi-Gaussian function, which allows independent selection of scales in the foreground and background. By selecting a narrow neighborhood for the background with regard to the foreground, the proposed method will reduce interference from adjacent objects simultaneously preserving the ability of intraregion smoothing. Our idea is inspired by a comparative analysis of existing line filters, in which several traditional methods, including the vesselness, gradient flux, and medialness models, are integrated into a uniform framework. The comparison subsequently aids in understanding the principles of different filtering kernels, which is also a contribution of this paper. Based on some axiomatic scale-space assumptions, the full representation of our bi-Gaussian kernel is deduced. The popular Î³-normalization scheme for multiscale integration is extended to the bi-Gaussian operators. Finally, combined with a parameter-free shape estimation scheme, a derivative filter is developed for the typical applications of curvilinear structure detection and vasculature image enhancement.

The matrix is produced by a special code sequence and a number of state transitions. A color projector is controlled by a computer to generate the desired color patterns in the scene. The unique indexing of the light codes is crucial here for color projection since it is essential that each light grid be uniquely identified by incorporating local neighborhoods so that 3D reconstruction can be performed with only local analysis of a single image.

This method is motivated by the observation that there exists a distinctive correlation between the sample images, belonging to the same kind of texture, at different frequency regions obtained by 2-D wavelet packet transform. Experimentally, it was observed that this correlation varies from texture to texture. The linear regression model is employed to analyze this correlation and extract texture features that characterize the samples. Therefore, our method considers not only the frequency regions but also the correlation between these regions. In contrast, the pyramid-structured wavelet transforms (PSWT) and the tree structured wavelet transform (TSWT) do not consider the correlation between different frequency regions.

In virtualized data centers, consolidation of Virtual Machines (VMs) on the minimum number of physical servers has been recognized as a very efficient approach, as this allows unloaded servers to be switched off or used to accommodate more load, which is clearly a cheaper alternative to buy more resources. The consolidation problem must be solved on multiple dimensions, since in modern data centers CPU is not the only critical resource: depending on the characteristics of the workload other resources, for example, RAM and bandwidth, can become the bottleneck. The problem is so complex that centralized and deterministic solutions are practically useless in large data centers with hundreds or thousands of servers.

Decisions on the assignment and migration of VMs are driven by probabilistic processes and are based exclusively on local information, which makes the approach very simple to implement.

Software quality metrics are not only the static measurement state of project but also it will help in assessing the behavior, size, quality and complexity etc, of software. Evaluation of software quality metrics is used to predict the fault-prone area and components of software in early stage of reengineering process of existing software as quality indicators. These software quality metrics helps to identify the problem from software in early stages of the reengineering of existing software. Therefore, this paper deals with automate software quality metrics tool namely Software Reverse Engineering Tool (SRET) which should be developed to determine the different software quality metrics and attributes of object oriented programming. Hence these metrics measures the complexity, effectiveness, efficiency of software and these metrics should be save time and cost of software analyzer, developer, tester etc., for reengineering the existing software with less effort.', '', '../admin/upload/ieee/1413208800_pxc3883448.pdf', '', NULL, '', '', '2014-10-13 19:28:20', 'N'),

To reduce data access cost and delay, caching has been widely used as an important technique. The efficiency of data access in caching systems largely depends on the cost for maintaining cache consistency, which can be high in wireless ad hoc networks due to network dynamism. Therefore, to make better trade-off between cache consistency and the cost incurred, it would be highly desirable to provide users the flexibility in specifying consistency requirements for their applications. In this paper, we propose a general consistency model called Probabilistic Delta Consistency (PDC), which integrates the flexibility granted by existing consistency models, covering them as special cases. We also propose the Flexible Combination of Push and Pull (FCPP) algorithm which satisfies user-specified consistency requirements under the PDC model. The analytical model of FCPP is used to derive the balance of minimizing the consistency maintenance cost and ensuring the specified consistency requirement. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate whether FCPP can satisfy arbitrarily specified consistency requirements, and whether FCPP works cost-effectively in dynamic wireless ad hoc networks. The evaluation results show that FCPP can adaptively tune itself to satisfy various user-specified consistency requirements.

Alternatively, building an index of precomputed results for some or all keywords involves very expensive preprocessing.

We materialize a number of relatively small subsets of the data graph in such a way that any keyword query can be answered by running ObjectRank on only one of the subgraphs. BinRank generates the subgraphs by partitioning all the terms in the corpus based on their co-occurrence, executing ObjectRank for each partition using the terms to generate a set of random walk starting points, and keeping only those objects that receive non-negligible scores.

As it cannot be cured, detecting the disease in time is important. Current tests using intraocular pressure (IOP) are not sensitive enough for population based glaucoma screening. Optic nerve head assessment in retinal fundus images is both more promising and superior. This paper proposes optic disc and optic cup segmentation using superpixel classification for glaucoma screening. In optic disc segmentation, histograms, and center surround statistics are used to classify each superpixel as disc or non-disc. A self-assessment reliability score is computed to evaluate the quality of the automated optic disc segmentation. For optic cup segmentation, in addition to the histograms and center surround statistics, the location information is also included into the feature space to boost the performance. The proposed segmentation methods have been evaluated in a database of 650 images with optic disc and optic cup boundaries manually marked by trained professionals. Experimental results show an average overlapping error of 9.5% and 24.1% in optic disc and optic cup segmentation, respectively. The results also show an increase in overlapping error as the reliability score is reduced, which justifies the effectiveness of the self-assessment. The segmented optic disc and optic cup are then used to compute the cup to disc ratio for glaucoma screening. Our proposed method achieves areas under curve of 0.800 and 0.822 in two data sets, which is higher than other methods. The methods can be used for segmentation and glaucoma screening.

In contrast, the theoretical background of the RWR scheme is different from that of the diffusion-reaction equation, although the restarting term of the RWR plays a role similar to the reaction term of the diffusion-reaction equation. The behaviors of the two approaches with respect to outliers reveal that they possess different attributes in terms of data propagation. This observation leads to the derivation of a new energy functional, where both volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity are considered together, and provides a common framework that unifies both the RW and the RWR approaches, in addition to other regularization methods.

The best lip motion features for speaker identification are considered to be those that result in the highest discrimination of individual speakers in a population, whereas for speech-reading, the best features are those providing the highest phoneme/word/phrase recognition rate. Several lip motion feature candidates have been considered including dense motion features within a bounding box about the lip, lip contour motion features, and combination of these with lip shape features. Furthermore, a novel two-stage, spatial, and temporal discrimination analysis is introduced to select the best lip motion features for speaker identification and speech-reading applications.

Owing to the high interrupt frequency and heavy cost per interrupt in high-speed network virtualization, the performance of network virtualization is closely correlated to the computing resource allocation policy in Virtual Machine Manager (VMM). Therefore, more sophisticated methods are needed to process irregularity and the high frequency of network interrupts in high-speed network virtualization environment. However, the I/O-intensive and CPU-intensive applications in virtual machines are treated in the same manner since application attributes are transparent to the scheduler in hypervisor, and this unawareness of workload makes virtual systems unable to take full advantage of high performance networks. In this paper, we discuss the SR-IOV networking solution and show by experiment that the current credit scheduler in Xen does not utilize high performance networks efficiently. Hence we propose a novel workload-aware scheduling model with two optimizations to eliminate the bottleneck caused by scheduler. In this model, guest domains are divided into I/O-intensive domains and CPU-intensive domains according to their monitored behaviour. I/O-intensive domains can obtain extra credits that CPU-intensive domains are willing to share. In addition, the total number of credits available is adjusted to accelerate the I/O responsiveness. Our experimental evaluations show that the new scheduling models improve bandwidth and reduce response time, by keeping the fairness between I/O-intensive and CPUintensive domains.

Conceptually, these algorithms require a query-time PageRank-style iterative computation over the full graph. This computation is too expensive for large graphs, and not feasible at query time. Alternatively, building an index of precomputed results for some or all keywords involves very expensive preprocessing. We introduce BinRank, a system that approximates ObjectRank results by utilizing a hybrid approach inspired by materialized views in traditional query processing. We materialize a number of relatively small subsets of the data graph in such a way that any keyword query can be answered by running ObjectRank on only one of the subgraphs. BinRank generates the subgraphs by partitioning all the terms in the corpus based on their co-occurrence, executing ObjectRank for each partition using the terms to generate a set of random walk starting points, and keeping only those objects that receive non-negligible scores. The intuition is that a subgraph that contains all objects and links relevant to a set of related terms should have all the information needed to rank objects with respect to one of these terms. We demonstrate that BinRank can achieve subsecond query execution time on the English Wikipedia data set, while producing high-quality search results that closely approximate the results of ObjectRank on the original graph. The Wikipedia link graph contains about 10^8 edges, which is at least two orders of magnitude larger than what prior state of the art dynamic authority-based search systems have been able to demonstrate.

However, both cannot fully explain why the unpredictability appears in the link state. In this paper, we unravel the following questions: 1) What causes frame losses that are directly related to intermediate link states? 2) Is RSSI or SINR a right criterion to represent the link reliability? 3) Is there a better measure to assess the link reliability? We first configured a testbed for performing a real measurement study to identify the causes of frame losses, and observed that link reliability depends on an intraframe SINR distribution, not a single value of RSSI (or SINR). We also learned that an RSSI value is not always a good indicator to estimate the link state. We then conducted a further investigation on the intraframe SINR distribution and the relationship between the SINR and link reliability with the ns-2 simulator. Based on these results, we finally propose an interference modeling framework for estimating link states in the presence of wireless interferences.

There is a lot of discussion on the benefits and\r\ncosts of the cloud model and on how to move legacy\r\napplications onto the cloud platform. Here we study a\r\ndifferent problem: how can a cloud service provider best\r\nmultiplex its virtual resources onto the physical hardware?\r\nThis is important because much of the touted gains in the\r\ncloud model come from such multiplexing. Studies have\r\nfound that servers in many existing data centers are often\r\nseverely underutilized due to overprovisioning for the peak\r\ndemand [1], [2]. The cloud model is expected to make such\r\npractice unnecessary by offering automatic scale up and\r\ndown in response to load variation. Besides reducing the\r\nhardware cost, it also saves on electricity which contributes\r\nto a significant portion of the operational expenses in large\r\ndata centers.\r\nVirtual machine monitors (VMMs) like Xen provide a\r\nmechanism for mapping virtual machines (VMs) to\r\nphysical resources [3]. This mapping is largely hidden\r\nfrom the cloud users. Users with the Amazon EC2 service\r\n[4], for example, do not know where their VM instances\r\nrun. It is up to the cloud provider to make sure the\r\nunderlying physical machines (PMs) have sufficient resources\r\nto meet their needs. VM live migration technology\r\nmakes it possible to change the mapping between VMs and\r\nPMs while applications are running [5], [6]. However, a\r\npolicy issue remains as how to decide the mapping\r\nadaptively so that the resource demands of VMs are met\r\nwhile the number of PMs used is minimized. This is\r\nchallenging when the resource needs of VMs are heterogeneous\r\ndue to the diverse set of applications they run and\r\nvary with time as the workloads grow and shrink. The\r\ncapacity of PMs can also be heterogenous because multiple\r\ngenerations of hardware coexist in a data center.\r\nWe aim to achieve two goals in our algorithm:\r\n. Overload avoidance. The capacity of a PM should be\r\nsufficient to satisfy the resource needs of all VMs\r\nrunning on it. Otherwise, the PM is overloaded and\r\ncan lead to degraded performance of its VMs.\r\n. Green computing. The number of PMs used should be\r\nminimized as long as they can still satisfy the needs\r\nof all VMs. Idle PMs can be turned off to save energy.\r\nThere is an inherent tradeoff between the two goals in the\r\nface of changing resource needs of VMs. For overload\r\navoidance, we should keep the utilization of PMs low to\r\nreduce the possibility of overload in case the resource needs\r\nof VMs increase later. For green computing, we should keep\r\nthe utilization of PMs reasonably high to make efficient use\r\nof their energy.\r\nIn this paper, we present the design and implementation\r\nof an automated resource management system that achieves\r\na good balance between the two goals.

It is particularly helpful in performing early and noninvasive diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms using phase contrast magnetic resonance angiographic (PC-MRA) images. The major challenges of developing a PC-MRA-based segmentation method are the significantly varying voxel intensity inside vessels with different flow velocities and the signal loss in the aneurysmal regions where turbulent flows occur. This paper proposes a novel intensity-based algorithm to segment intracranial vessels and the attached aneurysms. The proposed method can handle intensity varying vasculatures and also the low-contrast aneurysmal regions affected by turbulent flows. It is grounded on the use of multirange filters and local variances to extract intensity-based image features for identifying contrast varying vasculatures. The extremely low-intensity region affected by turbulent flows is detected according to the topology of the structure detected by multirange filters and local variances.

In addition, different components of the proposed method-the multirange filters, local variances, and topology-based detection-are evaluated in the comparison between the proposed method and its lower complexity variants. Owing to the analogy between these variants and existing vascular segmentation methods, this comparison also exemplifies the advantage of the proposed method over the existing approaches.

In this paper, we identify, formulate, and address the problem of QoS-guaranteed bandwidth shifting and redistribution among the interfacing gateways for maximizing their utility. Due to node mobility, bandwidth shifting is required for providing QoS-guarantee to the mobile nodes. However, shifting alone is not always sufficient for maintaining QoS-guarantee because of varying spectral efficiency across the associated channels, coupled with the corresponding protocol overhead involved with the computation of utility. We formulate bandwidth redistribution as an utility maximization problem, and solve it using a modified descending bid auction. In the proposed scheme, named as AQUM, each gateway aggregates the demands of all the connecting mobile nodes and makes a bid for the required amount of bandwidth.

The proposed system is based on three separate algorithms. In this model, the personâ€™s face is filmed by a camera in the first step by receiving 15fps video sequence. Then, the images are transformed from RGB space into YCbCr and HSV spaces. The face area is separated from other parts and highly accurate HDP is achieved. That the eyes are open or closed in a specific time interval is determined by focusing on thresholding and equations concerning the symmetry of human faces a finally using K-means Clustering, the frequency of yawning is identified. The proposed system has been implemented on four different video sequences with average accuracy of 93.18% and detection rate (DR) of 92.71% out of total 35000 image frames.

Among the emerging data-intensive applications are those which require their data to be transferred before a predefined deadline. We call these deadline-driven requests (DDRs). In such applications, data-transfer finish time (which must be accomplished before the deadline) is the key service guarantee that the customer wants. In fact, the amount of bandwidth allocated to transfer a request is not a concern for the customer as long as its service deadline is met. Hence, the service provider can choose the bandwidth (transmission rate) to provision the request. In this case, even though DDRs impose a deadline constraint, they provide scheduling flexibility for the service provider since it can choose the transmission rate while achieving two objectives: 1) satisfying the guaranteed deadline; and 2) optimizing the network''s resource utilization. We investigate the problem of provisioning DDRs with flexible transmission rates in wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) mesh networks, although this approach is generalizable to other networks also. We investigate several (fixed and adaptive to network state) bandwidth-allocation policies and study the benefit of allowing dynamic bandwidth adjustment, which is found to generally improve network performance. We show that the performance of the bandwidth-allocation algorithms depends on the DDR traffic distribution and on the node architecture and its parameters.

Clouds enlarged the offer of distributed computing systems by providing advanced Internet services that complement and complete functionalities of distributed computing provided by the Web, Grid computing and peer-to-peer networks. In fact, Cloud computing systems provide large-scale infrastructures for complex high-performance applications. Most of those applications use big data repositories and needs to access and analyze them to extract useful information. Big data is a new and over-used term that refers to massive, heterogeneous, and often unstructured digital content that is difficult to process using traditional data management tools and techniques. The term includes the complexity and variety of data and data types, real-time data collection and processing needs, and the value that can be obtained by smart analytics. Advanced data mining techniques and associated tools can help extract information from large, complex datasets that are useful in making informed decisions in many business and scientific applications including advertising, market sales, social studies, bioinformatics, and high-energy physics. Combining big data analytics and knowledge discovery techniques with scalable computing systems will produce new insights in a shorter time. Although a few cloud-based analytics platforms are available to-day, current research work foresees that they will become common within a few years. Some current solutions are open source systems such as Apache Hadoop and SciDB, while others are proprietary solutions provided by companies such as Google, IBM, EMC, BigML, Splunk Storm, Kognitio, and InsightsOne. As more such platforms emerge, researchers will port increasingly powerful data mining pro-gramming tools and strategies to the cloud to exploit complex and flexible software models such as the distributed workflow paradigm. The growing use of service-oriented computing could accelerate this trend. Developers and researchers can adopt the software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) models to implement big data analytics solutions in the cloud. In such a way, data mining tasks and knowledge discovery applications can be offered as high-level services on Clouds. This approach creates a new way to delivery data analysis software that is called data analytics as a service (DAaaS).

Recently, we extended the DMCF system to support also script-based data analysis workflows, as an additional and more flexible program-ming interface for skilled users.

First, SVM often suffers from learning with a small number of labeled examples, which is the case in relevance feedback. Second, SVM active learning usually does not take into account the redundancy among examples, and therefore could select multiple examples in relevance feedback that are similar (or even identical) to each other. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that exploits both semi-supervised kernel learning and batch mode active learning for relevance feedback in CBIR. In particular, a kernel function is first learned from a mixture of labeled and unlabeled examples.

If channels are statically allocated, as is the case in current cellular networks, a cell may run out of channels when a large number of mobile hosts move to the cell.

Such channel allocation approaches fall under two categories, namely, centralized and distributed. Centralized approaches are neither scalable nor reliable, while distributed approaches have the potential to be both reliable and scalable. In the distributed approaches, a mobile service station is responsible for allocating channels to mobile hosts in the same cell. In cellular networks, mobile service stations may fail.

Since the communication cost is the most dominant factor in a sensor''s energy consumption, we introduce an energy-efficient Virtual Energy-Based Encryption and Keying (VEBEK) scheme for WSNs that significantly reduces the number of transmissions needed for rekeying to avoid stale keys. In addition to the goal of saving energy, minimal transmission is imperative for some military applications of WSNs where an adversary could be monitoring the wireless spectrum. VEBEK is a secure communication framework where sensed data is encoded using a scheme based on a permutation code generated via the RC4 encryption mechanism. The key to the RC4 encryption mechanism dynamically changes as a function of the residual virtual energy of the sensor. Thus, a one-time dynamic key is employed for one packet only and different keys are used for the successive packets of the stream. The intermediate nodes along the path to the sink are able to verify the authenticity and integrity of the incoming packets using a predicted value of the key generated by the sender''s virtual energy, thus requiring no need for specific rekeying messages. VEBEK is able to efficiently detect and filter false data injected into the network by malicious outsiders. The VEBEK framework consists of two operational modes (VEBEK-I and VEBEK-II), each of which is optimal for different scenarios. In VEBEK-I, each node monitors its one-hop neighbors where VEBEK-II statistically monitors downstream nodes.

Based on this finding, we investigate a new cell-counting-based attack against Tor, which allows the attacker to confirm anonymous communication relationship among users very quickly. In this attack, by marginally varying the number of cells in the target traffic at the malicious exit onion router, the attacker can embed a secret signal into the variation of cell counter of the target traffic. The embedded signal will be carried along with the target traffic and arrive at the malicious entry onion router. Then, an accomplice of the attacker at themalicious entry onion router will detect the embedded signal based on the received cells and confirm the communication relationship among users. We have implemented this attack against Tor, and our experimental data validate its feasibility and effectiveness. There are several unique features of this attack. First, this attack is highly efficient and can confirm very short communication sessions with only tens of cells.

The main challenge of pressure routing in sparse underwater networks has been the efficient handling of 3D voids. In this respect, it was recently proven that the greedy stateless perimeter routing method, very popular in 2D networks, cannot be extended to void recovery in 3D networks. Available heuristics for 3D void recovery require expensive flooding. In this paper, we propose a Void-Aware Pressure Routing (VAPR) protocol that uses sequence number, hop count and depth information embedded in periodic beacons to set up next-hop direction and to build a directional trail to the closest sonobuoy. Using this trail, opportunistic directional forwarding can be efficiently performed even in the presence of voids.

The analytical framework captures the interactions among all infected hosts by a series of interdependent differential equations, which are then integrated into closed-form solutions that together present the overall worm behavior. We use the model to study how each worm/network parameter affects the worm propagation.

In a WSN, sensor nodes deliver sensed data back to the sink via multihopping.

We focus on two market models, one with a monopoly PU market and the other with a multiple-PU market. For the monopoly PU market model, we devise decentralized pricing-based spectrum access mechanisms that enable SUs to contend for channel usage. Specifically, we first consider SUs contending via slotted Aloha.

To mitigate the spectrum underutilization due to the â€œprice of contention,â€ we revisit the problem where SUs contend via CSMA, which results in more efficient spectrum utilization and higher revenue. We then study the tradeoff between the PU''s utility and its revenue when the PU''s salable spectrum is controllable. Next, for the multiple-PU market model, we cast the competition among PUs as a three-stage Stackelberg game, where each SU selects a PU''s channel to maximize its throughput. We explore the existence and the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium, in terms of access prices and the spectrum offered to SUs, and develop an iterative algorithm for strategy adaptation to achieve the Nash equilibrium.

The two-threshold criteria select wavelet coefficients based on their absolute value, spatial regularity, and regularity across multiresolution scales. The proposed algorithm takes image features into consideration in the selection process. Statistically, most images have regular features resulting in connected sub band coefficients. Therefore, the resulting sub bands of wavelet transformed images in large part do not contain isolated coefficients. In the proposed algorithm, coefficients are selected due to their magnitude, and only subsets of those selected coefficients which exhibit a spatially regular behavior remain for image reconstruction. Therefore, two thresholds are used in the coefficient selection process. The first threshold is used to distinguish coefficients of large magnitude and the second is used to distinguish coefficients of spatial regularity.

A feature selection algorithm may be evaluated from both the efficiency and effectiveness points of view. While the efficiency concerns the time required to find a subset of features, the effectiveness is related to the quality of the subset of features. Based on these criteria, a fast clustering-based feature selection algorithm (FAST) is proposed and experimentally evaluated in this paper. The FAST algorithm works in two steps. In the first step, features are divided into clusters by using graph-theoretic clustering methods. In the second step, the most representative feature that is strongly related to target classes is selected from each cluster to form a subset of features. Features in different clusters are relatively independent; the clustering-based strategy of FAST has a high probability of producing a subset of useful and independent features. To ensure the efficiency of FAST, we adopt the efficient minimum-spanning tree (MST) clustering method. The efficiency and effectiveness of the FAST algorithm are evaluated through an empirical study. Extensive experiments are carried out to compare FAST and several representative feature selection algorithms, namely, FCBF, ReliefF, CFS, Consist, and FOCUS-SF, with respect to four types of well-known classifiers, namely, the probabilitybased Naive Bayes, the tree-based C4.5, the instance-based IB1, and the rule-based RIPPER before and after feature selection. The results, on 35 publicly available real-world high-dimensional image, microarray, and text data, demonstrate that the FAST not only produces smaller subsets of features but also improves the performances of the four types of classifiers.', '', '', '', NULL, '', '', '2014-05-28 00:00:00', 'Y'),

All previous work on NUM assumed unicast transmissions; however, the wireless medium is by its nature broadcast and a transmission will be received by multiple nodes. The structure of our design is fundamentally different; this is due to the fact that our link rate constraints are defined per broadcast region instead of links in isolation.

Optimal MAC scheduling is difficult to implement, and we use 802.11-like random scheduling rather than optimal in our comparisons. Under random scheduling, our protocol becomes fully decentralized (we assume ideal signaling).

We propose a solution based on a coalition formation among mobile nodes to cooperatively deliver packets among these mobile nodes in the same coalition. A coalitional game is developed to analyze the behavior of the rational mobile nodes for cooperative packet delivery. A group of mobile nodes makes a decision to join or to leave a coalition based on their individual payoffs. The individual payoff of each mobile node is a function of the average delivery delay for packets transmitted to the mobile node from a base station and the cost incurred by this mobile node for relaying packets to other mobile nodes. To find the payoff of each mobile node, a Markov chain model is formulated and the expected cost and packet delivery delay are obtained when the mobile node is in a coalition. Since both the expected cost and packet delivery delay depend on the probability that each mobile node will help other mobile nodes in the same coalition to forward packets to the destination mobile node in the same coalition, a bargaining game is used to find the optimal helping probabilities. After the payoff of each mobile node is obtained, we find the solutions of the coalitional game which are the stable coalitions. A distributed algorithm is presented to obtain the stable coalitions and a Markov-chain-based analysis is used to evaluate the stable coalitional structures obtained from the distributed algorithm. Performance evaluation results show that when the stable coalitions are formed, the mobile nodes achieve a nonzero payoff (i.e., utility is higher than the cost).

The key idea behind the system is to hierarchically encrypt location information under different keys, and distribute the appropriate keys only to group members with the necessary permission. Four methods are proposed to deliver hierarchical location information while maintaining privacy. We propose a key tree rebalancing algorithm to maintain the re-keying performance of the group key management. Furthermore, we present a practical LBS system implementation.

In IEEE 802.11 Power Saving Mechanism (PSM), a packet must be advertised before it is actually transmitted. When a node receives an advertised packet that is not destined to it, it switches to a low power sleep state during the data transmission period, and thus, avoids overhearing and conserves energy. However, since some MANET routing protocols such as Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) collect route information via overhearing, they would suffer if they are used in combination with 802.11 PSM. Allowing no overhearing may critically deteriorate the performance of the underlying routing protocol, while unconditional overhearing may offset the advantage of using PSM. This paper proposes a new communication mechanism, called Random Cast, via which a sender can specify the desired level of overhearing, making a prudent balance between energy and routing performance. In addition, it reduces redundant rebroadcasts for a broadcast packet and thus saves more energy.

In this paper, we propose SocioNet, a social-based overlay that clusters peers based on their preference relationships as a small-world network. In SocioNet, peers mimic how people form a social network and how they query, by preference, their friends or acquaintances. Hence, SocioNet benefits from two desirable features of a social network: interest-based clustering and small-world properties (i.e., high cluster coefficient among all peers yet short path lengths between any two peers). To realize an interest-based small-world SocioNet, we also investigate the following practical design issues: 1) similarity estimation: we define a quantifiable similarity measure that enables clustering of similar peers in SocioNet; 2) distributed small-world overlay adaptation: peers maintain a small-world overlay under network dynamics; and 3) query strategy under the small-world overlay: we analyze appropriate settings for the Time-to-Live (TTL) value, for TTL-limited flooding, that provides a satisfactory success ratio and avoids redundant message overhead. We use simulations and a real database called AudioScrobbler [CHECK END OF SENTENCE], which tracks users'' listening habits, to evaluate the performance of SocioNet.

The jammer controls the probability of jamming and the transmission range in order to cause maximal damage to the network in terms of corrupted communication links. The jammer action ceases when it is detected by the network (namely by a monitoring node), and a notification message is transferred out of the jammed region. The jammer is detected by employing an optimal detection test based on the percentage of incurred collisions. On the other hand, the network defends itself by computing the channel access probability to minimize the jamming detection plus notification time. The necessary knowledge of the jammer in order to optimize its benefit consists of knowledge about the network channel access probability and the number of neighbors of the monitor node. Accordingly, the network needs to know the jamming probability of the jammer. We study the idealized case of perfect knowledge by both the jammer and the network about the strategy of each other and the case where the jammer and the network lack this knowledge. The latter is captured by formulating and solving optimization problems where the attacker and the network respond optimally to the worst-case or the average-case strategies of the other party. We also take into account potential energy constraints of the jammer and the network. We extend the problem to the case of multiple observers and adaptable jamming transmission range and propose a meaningful heuristic algorithm for an efficient jamming strategy.

It thus eliminates the need for certificate-based authenticated public-key distribution indispensable in conventional public-key management schemes. IKM features a novel construction method of ID-based public/private keys, which not only ensures high-level tolerance to node compromise, but also enables efficient network-wide key update via a single broadcast message. We also provide general guidelines about how to choose the secret-sharing parameters used with threshold cryptography to meet desirable levels of security and robustness.

Subsequently, we produce a probabilistic spatiotemporal model for the target event that can find the center of the event location. We regard each Twitter user as a sensor and apply particle filtering, which are widely used for location estimation. The particle filter works better than other comparable methods for estimating the locations of target events. As an application, we develop an earthquake reporting system for use in Japan.

The concept-based mining model can effectively discriminate between nonimportant terms with respect to sentence semantics and terms which hold the concepts that represent the sentence meaning. The proposed mining model consists of sentence-based concept analysis, document-based concept analysis, corpus-based concept-analysis, and concept-based similarity measure. The term which contributes to the sentence semantics is analyzed on the sentence, document, and corpus levels rather than the traditional analysis of the document only. The proposed model can efficiently find significant matching concepts between documents, according to the semantics of their sentences. The similarity between documents is calculated based on a new concept-based similarity measure. The proposed similarity measure takes full advantage of using the concept analysis measures on the sentence, document, and corpus levels in calculating the similarity between documents. Large sets of experiments using the proposed concept-based mining model on different data sets in text clustering are conducted. The experiments demonstrate extensive comparison between the concept-based analysis and the traditional analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the substantial enhancement of the clustering - - quality using the sentence-based, document-based, corpus-based, and combined approach concept analysis.', '', '', '', NULL, '', '', '2014-06-05 00:00:00', 'Y'),

The allocation of VM instances to users is usually determined through fixed-price allocation mechanisms that cannot guarantee an economically efficient allocation and the maximization of cloud provider''s revenue. A better alternative would be to use combinatorial auction-based resource allocation mechanisms. This argument is supported by the economic theory; when the auction costs are low, as is the case in the context of cloud computing, auctions are especially efficient over the fixed-price markets because products are matched to customers having the highest valuation. The existing combinatorial auction-based VM allocation mechanisms do not take into account the user''s demand when making provisioning decisions, that is, they assume that the VM instances are statically provisioned. We design an auction-based mechanism for dynamic VM provisioning and allocation that takes into account the user demand, when making provisioning decisions.

An unseen object is predicted to be a certain class if it falls within the corresponding class hypercuboid. Based upon the method, ensemble rough hypercuboid classifiers are subsequently constructed. Experimental results on some open cancer gene expression data sets show that the proposed method is capable of generating accurate and interpretable rules compared with some other machine learning methods. Hence, it is a feasible way of classifying cancer tissues in biomedical applications.', '', '', '', NULL, '', '', '2014-06-05 00:00:00', 'Y'),

Top ranked results are expected to convey as little redundant information as possible, and cover as many aspects as possible. However, existing ranking approaches either take no account of diversity, or handle it separately with some heuristics. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Manifold Ranking with Sink Points (MRSPs), to address diversity as well as relevance and importance in ranking. Specifically, our approach uses a manifold ranking process over the data manifold, which can naturally find the most relevant and important data objects. Meanwhile, by turning ranked objects into sink points on data manifold, we can effectively prevent redundant objects from receiving a high rank. MRSP not only shows a nice convergence property, but also has an interesting and satisfying optimization explanation.

We establish the conditions under which the IDPF framework works correctly in that it does not discard packets with valid source addresses.

The goal is to disseminate all messages efficiently, hopefully achieving an order-optimal spreading rate over unicast wireless random networks. First, we show that a random-push strategy-where a user sends its own or a received packet at random-is order-wise suboptimal in a random geometric graph: specifically, Î©(âˆšn) times slower than optimal spreading. It is known that this gap can be closed if each user has â€œfullâ€ mobility, since this effectively creates a complete graph. We instead consider velocity-constrained mobility where at each time slot the user moves locally using a discrete random walk with velocity v(n) that is much lower than full mobility. We propose a simple two-stage dissemination strategy that alternates between individual message flooding (â€œself promotionâ€) and random gossiping. We prove that this scheme achieves a close to optimal spreading rate (within only a logarithmic gap) as long as the velocity is at least v(n)=Ï‰(âˆš(logn/k)).

To identify application DoS attack, we propose a novel group testing (GT)-based approach deployed on back-end servers, which not only offers a theoretical method to obtain short detection delay and low false positive/negative rate, but also provides an underlying framework against general network attacks. More specifically, we first extend classic GT model with size constraints for practice purposes, then redistribute the client service requests to multiple virtual servers embedded within each back-end server machine, according to specific testing matrices.

Many proposals have been made in order to improve the efficiency in answering ranked queries.

A common approach in intrusion detection models, specifically in anomaly detection models, is to use classifiers as detectors. Selecting the best set of features is central to ensuring the performance, speed of learning, accuracy, and reliability of these detectors as well as to remove noise from the set of features used to construct the classifiers. In most current systems, the features used for training and testing the intrusion detection systems consist of basic information related to the TCP/IP header, with no considerable attention to the features associated with lower level protocol frames. The resulting detectors were efficient and accurate in detecting network attacks at the network and transport layers, but unfortunately, not capable of detecting 802.11-specific attacks such as deauthentication attacks or MAC layer DoS attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model that efficiently selects the optimal set of features in order to detect 802.11-specific intrusions. Our model for feature selection uses the information gain ratio measure as a means to compute the relevance of each feature and the k-means classifier to select the optimal set of MAC layer features that can improve the accuracy of intrusion detection systems while reducing the learning time of their learning algorithm. In the experimental section of this paper, we study the impact of the optimization of the feature set for wireless intrusion detection systems on the performance and learning time of different types of classifiers based on neural networks.

On the other hand, some data is critical to the functioning of the whole network. For instance, the existence and position of a gateway towards the infrastructure network should be kept somewhere in the network, so that nodes are able to recover this information when needed.

These schemes authenticate the user by session passwords. Session passwords are passwords that are used only once. Once the session is terminated, the session password is no longer useful. For every login process, users input different passwords. The session passwords provide better security against dictionary and brute force attacks as password changes for every session. The proposed authentication schemes use text and colors for generating session passwords.\r\nThe most common method used for authentication is textual password. The vulnerabilities of this method like eves dropping, dictionary attack, social engineering and shoulder surfing are well known. Random and lengthy passwords can make the system secure. But the main problem is the difficulty of remembering those passwords. Studies have shown that users tend to pick short passwords or passwords that are easy to remember. Unfortunately, these passwords can be easily guessed or cracked. The alternative techniques are graphical passwords and biometrics. But these two techniques have their own disadvantages. Biometrics, such as finger prints, iris scan or facial recognition have been introduced but not yet widely adopted. The major drawback of this approach is that such systems can be expensive and the identification process can be slow.\r\nThere are many graphical password schemes that are proposed in the last decade. But most of them suffer from shoulder surfing which is becoming quite a big problem. There are graphical passwords schemes that have been proposed which are resistant to shoulder-surfing but they have their own drawbacks like usability issues or taking more time for user to login or having tolerance levels. Personal Digital Assistants are being used by the people to store their personal and confidential information like passwords and PIN numbers.

The admin can control whosoever is logging on the network and can allow or deny access the process. This is a relatively simple and user friendly applications the user can need not to be tech savvy to use this application. Even the user with basic computer knowledge can use this system with relative ease.\r\nA graphical representation is used to describe and analysis the moment of data through a system manual or automated including the process, storing of data and design in the system. Data flow diagrams are the central tool and the basis from which other components are developed. The transformation of data from input to output through process may be described logically and independently of the physical components associated with the system.

A complementary approach consists of improving the track management, that is, deciding when to add a target or stop its tracking, for example, in case of failure. This is an essential component for effective multiobject tracking applications, and is often not trivial. Deciding whether or not to stop a track is a compromise between avoiding erroneous early stopping while tracking is fine, and erroneous continuation of tracking when there is an actual failure. This decision process, very rarely addressed in the literature, is difficult due to object detector deficiencies or observation models that are insufficient to describe the full variability of tracked objects and deliver reliable likelihood (tracking) information. This paper addresses the track management issue and presents a real-time online multiface tracking algorithm that effectively deals with the above difficulties. The tracking itself is formulated in a multiobject state-space Bayesian filtering framework solved with Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Within this framework, an explicit probabilistic filtering step decides when to add or remove a target from the tracker, where decisions rely on multiple cues such as face detections, likelihood measures, long-term observations, and track state characteristics.

In addition to the large number and severe resource constraint of sensor nodes, a particular challenge comes from potential insider attacks due to possible node compromise, since a WSN is usually deployed in unattended/hostile environments. Existing security designs provide a hop-by-hop security paradigm only, which leaves the end-to-end data security at high stake. Data confidentiality and authenticity is highly vulnerable to insider attacks, and the multihop transmission of messages aggravates the situation. Moreover, data availability is not sufficiently addressed in existing security designs, many of which are highly vulnerable to many types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, such as report disruption attacks, selective forwarding attacks, etc. In this paper, we seek feasible solutions to overcome these vulnerabilities. Through exploiting the static and location-aware nature of WSNs, we come up with a location-aware end-to-end security framework in which each node only stores a few secret keys and those secret keys are bound to the node-s geographic location. The property of the location-aware keys successfully limits the impact of compromised nodes to their vicinity.

To guarantee the quality of service for each mobile user in such single-hop multicasting, the base-station transmitter usually adapts its data rate to the worst channel condition among all users in a multicast group. On one hand, increasing the number of users in a multicast group leads to a more efficient utilization of spectrum bandwidth, as users in the same group can be served together. On the other hand, too many users in a group may lead to unacceptably low data rate at which the base station can transmit. Hence, a natural question that arises is how to efficiently and fairly transmit to a large number of users requiring the same message. This paper endeavors to answer this question by studying the problem of multicasting over multicarriers in wireless orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) cellular systems. Using a unified utility maximization framework, we investigate this problem in two typical scenarios: namely, when users experience roughly equal path losses and when they experience different path losses, respectively. Through theoretical analysis, we obtain optimal multicast schemes satisfying various throughput-fairness requirements in these two cases. In particular, we show that the conventional multicast scheme is optimal in the equal-path-loss case regardless of the utility function adopted. When users experience different path losses, the group multicast scheme, which divides the users almost equally into many multicast groups and multicasts to different groups of users over nonoverlapping subcarriers, is optimal .', '', '', '', NULL, '', '', '2014-06-05 00:00:00', 'Y');

Existing security designs provide a hop-by-hop security paradigm only, which leaves the end-to-end data security at high stake. Data confidentiality and authenticity is highly vulnerable to insider attacks, and the multihop transmission of messages aggravates the situation. Moreover, data availability is not sufficiently addressed in existing security designs, many of which are highly vulnerable to many types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, such as report disruption attacks, selective forwarding attacks, etc. In this paper, we seek feasible solutions to overcome these vulnerabilities.

The property of the location-aware keys successfully limits the impact of compromised nodes to their vicinity.

This problem becomes more visible especially in large-scale transmission of heavy traffic such as multimedia data, where congestion is more probable and the negative impact of packet loss on the service quality is of more significance. We argue that routing should not only be aware of, but also be adaptive to, network congestion. Hence, we propose a routing protocol (CRP) with such properties.

This trend however is throttled by the limited battery lifetime of mobile devices and unstable wireless connectivity, making the highest possible quality of service experienced by mobile users not feasible. The recent cloud computing technology, with its rich resources to compensate for the limitations of mobile devices and connections, can potentially provide an ideal platform to support the desired mobile services. Tough challenges arise on how to effectively exploit cloud resources to facilitate mobile services, especially those with stringent interaction delay requirements. In this paper, we propose the design of a Cloud-based, novel Mobile social TV system (CloudMoV). The system effectively utilizes both PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a- Service) cloud services to offer the living-room experience of video watching to a group of disparate mobile users who can interact socially while sharing the video. To guarantee good streaming quality as experienced by the mobile users with time varying wireless connectivity, we employ a surrogate for each user in the IaaS cloud for video downloading and social exchanges on behalf of the user. The surrogate performs efficient stream transcoding that matches the current connectivity quality of the mobile user. Given the battery life as a key performance bottleneck, we advocate the use of burst transmission from the surrogates to the mobile users, and carefully decide the burst size which can lead to high energy efficiency and streaming quality. Social interactions among the users, in terms of spontaneous textual exchanges, are effectively achieved by efficient designs of data storage with Big Table and dynamic handling of large volumes of concurrent messages in a typical PaaS cloud. These various designs for flexible transcoding capabilities, battery efficiency of mobile devices and spontaneous social interactivity together provide an ideal platform for mobile social TV services.

ID is often formulated as an optimization problem, where the objective function includes a data term encouraging the estimated image (and blur, in blind ID) to explain the observed data well (typically, the squared norm of a residual) plus a regularizer that penalizes solutions deemed undesirable. The performance of this approach depends critically (among other things) on the relative weight of the regularizer (the regularization parameter) and on the number of iterations of the algorithm used to address the optimization problem. In this paper, we propose new criteria for adjusting the regularization parameter and/or the number of iterations of ID algorithms. The rationale is that if the recovered image (and blur, in blind ID) is well estimated, the residual image is spectrally white; contrarily, a poorly deblurred image typically exhibits structured artifacts (e.g., ringing, oversmoothness), yielding residuals that are not spectrally white. The proposed criterion is particularly well suited to a recent blind ID algorithm that uses continuation, i.e., slowly decreases the regularization parameter along the iterations; in this case, choosing this parameter and deciding when to stop are one and the same thing.

However, dealing with occlusions covering the facial surface is a great challenge, which should be handled to enable applicability to fully automatic security systems. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic 3-D face recognition system which is robust to occlusions. We basically consider two problems: 1) occlusion handling for surface registration, and 2) missing data handling for classification based on subspace analysis techniques. For the alignment problem, we employ an adaptively-selected-model-based registration scheme, where a face model is selected for an occluded face such that only the valid nonoccluded patches are utilized. After registering to the model, occlusions are detected and removed. In the classification stage, a masking strategy, which we call masked projection, is proposed to enable the use of subspace analysis techniques with incomplete data. Furthermore, a regional scheme suitable for occlusion handling is incorporated in classification to improve the overall results. Experimental results on two databases with realistic facial occlusions, namely, the Bosphorus and the UMB-DB, are reported. Experimental results confirm that registration based on the adaptively selected model together with the masked subspace analysis classification offer an occlusion robust face recognition system.', '', '', '', NULL, '', '', '2014-06-05 00:00:00', 'Y'),

It consists of a WML language, a WML Script, and a Wireless Telephony Application Interface (WTAI). The use of WAP-enabled mobile phones is booming. Cellular phones with support for WAP allow users to access a wide variety of services.

Cloud computing comes into center of\r\nattention immediately when you think about what IT constantly needs: a means to increase capacity or add\r\ncapabilities on the fly without investing in new infrastructure, training new human resources, or licensing new\r\nsoftware. The cloud should provide resources on demand to its clients with high availability, scalability and\r\nwith reduced cost.

Multihomed end networks today can employ a variety of route control products to optimize their Internet access performance and reliability. However, little is known about the tangible benefits that such products can offer, the mechanisms they employ and their trade-offs. This paper makes two important contributions. First, we present a study of the potential improvements in Internet round-trip times (RTTs) and transfer speeds from employing multihoming route control. Our analysis shows that multihoming to three or more ISPs and cleverly scheduling traffic across the ISPs can improve Internet RTTs and throughputs by up to 25% and 20%, respectively. However, a careful selection of ISPs is important to realize the performance improvements. Second, focusing on large enterprises, we propose and evaluate a wide-range of route control mechanisms and evaluate their design trade-offs. We implement the proposed schemes on a Linux-based Web proxy and perform a trace-based evaluation of their performance. We show that both passive and active measurement-based techniques are equally effective and could improve the Web response times of enterprise networks by up to 25% on average, compared to using a single ISP.

This steganography technique exploits the weakness of the human visual\r\nsystem (HVS). HVS cannot detect the variation in luminance of color vectors at\r\nhigher frequency side of the visual spectrum. A picture can be represented by a\r\ncollection of color pixels. The individual pixels can be represented by their optical\r\ncharacteristics like ''brightness'', ''chroma'' etc. Each of these characteristics can be\r\ndigitally expressed in terms of 1s and 0s.</br>\r\nFor example: a 24-bit bitmap will have 8 bits, representing each of the threecolor\r\nvalues (red, green, and blue) at each pixel. If we consider just the blue\r\nthere will be 28 different values of blue. The difference between 11111111 and\r\n11111110 in the value for blue intensity is likely to be undetectable by the\r\nhuman eye. Hence, if the terminal recipient of the data is nothing but human\r\nvisual system (HVS) then the Least Significant Bit (LSB) can be used for\r\nsomething else other than color information.\r\nThis technique can be directly applied on digital image in bitmap format as well\r\nas for the compressed image format like JPEG. In JPEG format, each pixel of the\r\nimage is digitally coded using discrete cosine transformation (DCT). The LSB of\r\nencoded DCT components can be used as the carriers of the hidden message.\r\nThe details of above techniques are explained below:</br>â€¢Modification of LSB of a cover image in ''bitmap'' format .\r\nIn this method binary equivalent of the message (to be hidden) is distributed\r\namong the LSBs of each pixel. For example we will try to hide the character â€˜Aâ€™\r\ninto an 8-bit color image.\r\nWe are taking eight consecutive pixels from top left corner of the image. The\r\nequivalent binary bit pattern of those pixels may be like this: -</br>\r\n00100111 11101001 11001000 00100111 11001000 11101001\r\n11001000 00100111</br>\r\nThen each bit of binary equivalence of letter ''A'' i.e. 01100101 are copied serially\r\n(from the left hand side) to the LSB''s of equivalent binary pattern of pixels,\r\nresulting the bit pattern will become like this: -</br>\r\n00100110 11101001 11001001 00100110 11001000 11101001\r\n11001000 00100111</br>\r\nThe only problem with this technique is that it is very vulnerable to attacks such\r\nas image compression and formatting.</br>\r\nâ€¢Apply of LSB technique during discrete cosine transformation (DCT) on cover\r\nimage.</br>\r\nThe following steps are followed in this case: -</br>\r\n1.The Image is broken into data units each of them consists of 8 x 8 block of\r\npixels.</br>\r\n2.Working from top-left to bottom-right of the cover image, DCT is applied to\r\neach pixel of each data unit.</br>\r\n3.After applying DCT, one DCT Coefficient is generated for each pixel in data\r\nunit.</br>\r\n4.Each DCT coefficient is then quantized against a reference quantization\r\ntable.</br>\r\n5.

Some of them\r\nare as follows: - </br>\r\nïƒ˜ LSB Coding: Sampling technique followed by Quantization converts\r\nanalog audio signal to digital binary sequence.</br>In this technique LSB of binary sequence of each sample of digitized audio\r\nfile is replaced with binary equivalent of secret message.\r\nFor example if we want to hide the letter â€˜Aâ€™ (binary equivalent\r\n01100101) to an digitized audio file where each sample is represented\r\nwith 16 bits, then LSB of 8 consecutive samples (each of 16 bit size) is\r\nreplaced with each bit of binary equivalent of the letter â€˜Aâ€™. </br>ïƒ˜ Phase Coding:\r\nHuman Auditory System (HAS) canâ€™t recognize the phase change in audio\r\nsignal as easy it can recognize noise in the signal. The phase coding\r\nmethod exploits this fact. This technique encodes the secret message bits\r\nas phase shifts in the phase spectrum of a digital signal, achieving an\r\ninaudible encoding in terms of signal-to- noise ratio.</br>\r\nïƒ˜ Spread Spectrum :\r\nThere are two approaches are used in this technique: the direct sequence\r\nspread spectrum (DSSS) and frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS).\r\nDirect-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) is a modulation technique used\r\nin telecommunication. As with other spread spectrum technologies, the\r\ntransmitted signal takes up more bandwidth than the information signal\r\nthat is being modulated. </br>\r\nDirect-sequence spread-spectrum transmissions multiply the data being\r\ntransmitted by a "noise" signal. This noise signal is a pseudorandom\r\nsequence of 1 and âˆ’1 values, at a frequency much higher than that of the\r\noriginal signal, thereby spreading the energy of the original signal into a\r\nmuch wider band. </br>\r\nThe resulting signal resembles white noise. However, this noise-like signal\r\ncan be used to exactly reconstruct the original data at the receiving end,\r\nby multiplying it by the same pseudorandom sequence (because 1 Ã— 1 =\r\n1, and âˆ’1 Ã— âˆ’1 = 1). This process, known as "de-spreading",\r\nmathematically constitutes a correlation of the transmitted Pseudorandom\r\nNoise (PN) sequence with the receiver''s assumed sequence.\r\nFor de-spreading to work correctly, the transmit and receive sequences\r\nmust be synchronized. This requires the receiver to synchronize its\r\nsequence with the transmitter''s sequence via some sort of timing search\r\nprocess. </br>\r\nIn contrast, frequency-hopping spread spectrum pseudo-randomly retunes\r\nthe carrier, instead of adding pseudo-random noise to the data,\r\nwhich results in a uniform frequency distribution whose width is\r\ndetermined by the output range of the pseudo-random number generator. </br>\r\nïƒ˜ Echo Hiding:\r\nIn this method the secret message is embedded into cover audio signal as\r\nan echo. Three parameters of the echo of the cover signal namely\r\namplitude, decay rate and offset from original signal are varied to\r\nrepresent encoded secret binary message. They are set below to the\r\nthreshold of Human Auditory System (HAS) so that echo canâ€™t be easily\r\nresolved. </br>\r\nVideo files are generally consists of images and sounds, so most of the\r\nrelevant techniques for hiding data into images and audio are also applicable\r\nto video media. In the case of Video steganography sender sends the\r\nsecret message to the recipient using a video sequence as cover media.\r\nOptional secret key â€˜Kâ€™ can also be used during embedding the secret\r\nmessage to the cover media to produce â€˜stego-videoâ€™.\r\nAfter that the stego-video is communicated over public channel to the receiver.\r\nAt the receiving end, receiver uses the secret key along with the\r\nextracting algorithm to extract the secret message from the stego-object.\r\nThe original cover video consists of frames represented by Ck(m,n) where\r\n1 ï‚£ï€ k ï‚£ï€ N. â€˜Nâ€™ is the total number of frame and m,n are the row and column\r\nindices of the pixels, respectively. The binary secret message denoted\r\nby Mk(m, n) is embedded into the cover video media by modulating it\r\ninto a signal. Mk(m, n) is defined over the same domain as the host Ck(m,\r\nn).The stego-video signal is represented by the equation</br>\r\nSk(m, n) = Ck(m, n)+ï¡k (m, n) Mk(m, n) , k = 1, 2, 3 . . .N</br>\r\nwhere ï¡k (m, n) is a scaling factor. For simplicity ï¡k (m, n) can be considered\r\nto be constant over all the pixels and frames.\r\nSo the equation becomes: </br>\r\nSk(m, n) = Ck(m, n)+ï¡ï€ (m, n) Mk(m, n) , k = 1, 2, 3 . . .N</br>\r\n', '', '2014-07-21 00:00:00'),

Security is often as good as or better than other traditional systems, in part because providers are able to devote resources to solving security issues that many customers cannot afford. However, the complexity of security is greatly increased when data is distributed over a wider area or greater number of devices and in multi-tenant systems that are being shared by unrelated users. In addition, user access to security audit logs may be difficult or impossible. Private cloud installations are in part motivated by users'' desire to retain control over the infrastructure and avoid losing control of information security.<br/>\r\n 7.

It is characterized by the representation of discrete time, discrete frequency, or other discrete domain signals by a sequence of numbers or symbols and the processing of these signals.\r\n\r\nThe goal of DSP is usually to measure, filter and/or compress continuous real-world analog signals. The first step is usually to convert the signal from an analog to a digital form, by sampling and then digitizing it using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which turns the analog signal into a stream of numbers. However, often, the required output signal is another analog output signal, which requires a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Even if this process is more complex than analog processing and has a discrete value range, the application of computational power to digital signal processing allows for many advantages over analog processing in many applications, such as error detection and correction in transmission as well as data compression.[1]\r\n\r\nDigital signal processing and analog signal processing are subfields of signal processing. DSP applications include: audio and speech signal processing, sonar and radar signal processing, sensor array processing, spectral estimation, statistical signal processing, digital image processing, signal processing for communications, control of systems, biomedical signal processing, seismic data processing, etc. DSP algorithms have long been run on standard computers, as well as on specialized processors called digital signal processor and on purpose-built hardware such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASICs).

The messages are either represented by a sequence of pulses by means of a line code (baseband transmission), or by a limited set of continuously varying wave forms (passband transmission), using a digital modulation method. The passband modulation and corresponding demodulation (also known as detection) is carried out by modem equipment. According to the most common definition of digital signal, both baseband and passband signals representing bit-streams are considered as digital transmission, while an alternative definition only considers the baseband signal as digital, and passband transmission of digital data as a form of digital-to-analog conversion.', 'http://eewtech.in/manager/tutorial/index.php'),

Like the traditional client-server model or older mainframe computing,[1] a user connects with a server to perform a task. The difference with cloud computing is that the computing process may run on one or many connected computers at the same time, utilizing the concept of virtualization. With virtualization, one or more physical servers can be configured and partitioned into multiple independent "virtual" servers, all functioning independently and appearing to the user to be a single physical device. Such virtual servers do not physically exist and can therefore be moved around and scaled up or down on the fly without affecting the end user. The computing resources have become "granular", which provides end user and operator benefits including on-demand self-service, broad access across multiple devices, resource pooling, rapid elasticity and service metering capability.[2]\r\n\r\nIn more detail, cloud computing refers to a computing hardware machine or group of computing hardware machines commonly referred as a server or servers connected through a communication network such as the Internet, an intranet, a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN).

Therefore, instead of using a personal computer every-time to run the application, the individual can now run the application from anywhere in the world, as the server provides the processing power to the application and the server is also connected to a network via Internet or other connection platforms to be accessed from anywhere [33].
